Also, since the air is so much thinner at high altitude the resistance against the aircraft (drag) is much reduced, meaning they jet burns less fuel for the same effect. This translates into much better fuel economy, leaving more money per mile for the airline. Also, airliners cruise at different altitudes with a minimum 500' of separation. This makes for a lot of different \"lanes\" for them to use, and makes it safer for many planes to be in the air at the same time, reducing the chance of collision.",

The spleen, (sometimes referred to as the body's biggest lymph node), is an organ found in the left upper abdomen underneath the ribcage which becomes enlarged or swollen in about 50% of patients with \"mono.\" An enlarged liver may also occur. About 5% of patients have a splotchy red rash over the body, which has a similar appearance to the rash of measles. . . How is \"mono\" diagnosed? . . The diagnosis of \"mono\" is suspected by the doctor based on the above symptoms and signs. \"Mono\" is confirmed by blood tests while testing to exclude other possible causes of the symptoms. Early in the course of the illness, blood tests show an increase in a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte). Some of these increased lymphocytes are unusual or \"atypical\" lymphocytes, which suggest \"mono.\" More specific testing, such as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests, can confirm the diagnosis of \"mono.\" These tests rely on the body's immune system to make measurable antibodies against the EBV. Unfortunately, the antibodies may not become detectable until the second or third weeks of the illness. A blood chemistry test can reveal abnormalities in liver function. Testing to exclude the possibility of a strep throat is also considered for some patients."

        "answer": [
            "Joey---- That is just stupid, the ingrediants are not burnt. . . And is more of a Ruby color when you hold it up to light.. . Guiness is a light porter, if there are plenty of dark beers out there not just guiness. Porters, stouts, and other deep black beers are the most popular type. If you want a more detailed explanation of WHY it is black, take a trip to www.beeradvocate.com. . Here is an exert from a recent interview with Fergal Murray, a guiness brewaster. . \"A lot of Guinness lovers swear the beer’s color has recently changed from black to ruby red. Murray insisted otherwise; rather, only certain types of glassware (like the company’s own narrow-bottomed vessels), he said, truly showcase the beer’s ruby hue.\". . Most Americans look at Stout as a thick, murky, \"eat it with a spoon\" beer. It is also a common misconception that these black beers are more potent, simply due to their appearance. Plenty of Bostonians see it as a nitro forced black beverage and happily quaff down several pints a night with out a second thought, usually a Guinness Draught or Murphy's. Guinness has less alcohol than Budweiser, around 4.2% alcohol by volume (on tap, 4.1% draught can, in the US) which would explain why everyone can drink so much of it, so quickly, and why it has become a popular session beer. But, here's a little Stout 101 for the novices, for those that might want to switch things up a bit: We have all been to one of the many Irish pubs in the area, and friends or co-workers talk in awe about Guinness and how it is the best stout, if not beer, in the world. Not entirely true. The modern day Guinness \"on draught version\" is definitely the best selling Stout in the world, but there's more to the story.. . There are many variations of the stout beer style. Some are dry and some are sweet, some hoppy and some alcoholic. All have that common characteristic of a roasted flavour that sets them apart from any other style. Usually this roasted character comes from the use of roasted barley, which is barley grain that has not been malted, but rather highly kilned. The process imparts a uniqueness to the grain and creates flavours ranging from bitter unsweetened chocolate to coffee, to a dry grain astringency.. . In the late 1600's to early 1700's, the term \"stout\" was often used to reference a strong beer. When the term actually became a style is up for interpretation, however, what we do know is that back in the late 1700's, when Guinness was first brewing what was then called its Porter, it was not brewing the light bodied easy to suck down creamy stout that most imbibers enjoy today. It was a dark murky looking brew, standing, roughly, a whopping 7.5% abv. Guinness first brewed a strong export style to be shipped to the Caribbean, an Export / Foreign Stout, hence the name Guinness Foreign Export Strong Porter (later to be called, Foreign Extra Stout). It had a very complex, huge body, big hop profile and an intense robust character. You can still purchase it today -- and it's very much brewed the same way -- but only in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.. . In the very late 1700's, some English breweries produced an export stout, similar to a foreign export, specifically for the Baltic area. This variation was called a Russian Imperial Stout.

        "question": "What is a pleural effusion?",
        "answer": [
            "Fluid that accumulates in the pleural space because of trauma or disease is called pleural effusion. This condition may result from heart failure, cancer, pulmonary embolism, or inflammation. If blood is in the accumulating fluid, the condition is called \"hemothorax\"; if pus is present, it is called \"empyema\"; if air enters the space, it is called \"pneumothorax\"; and if there is chyle (milky fluid consisting of lymph and fat), it is called \"chylothorax.\" There are two types of pleural effusion, transudative and exudative. . . An imbalance between the venous-arterial pressure and the pressure within the pleural space (oncotic pressure) causes transudative effusions. Transudates contain few protein cells and little solid material content and have a clear, pale yellow color. Cardiac failure and, less commonly, liver and kidney disease cause transudative pleural effusion. . . Exudative effusions are caused by inflammation, infection, and cancer. Exudates have large amounts of protein cells, white blood cells, and immune cells that have migrated into the pleural fluid and deposited in tissues or on tissue surfaces. Exudates also are pale yellow in color but have a cloudy appearance. If pus is present because of infection (empyema), the fluid is yellow, cloudy, and has a foul odor. Pneumonia, tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism (blocked pulmonary artery), cancer, and trauma are common causes of exudative pleural effusion. . Mechanisms of Pleural Fluid Accumulation . An excessive amount of pleural fluid probably results from a combination of fluid draining into the tissues from the blood vessels and the overproduction of fluid by the mesothelial cells. Fluid accumulates in the pleural space by three mechanisms: increased drainage of fluid into the space, increased production of fluid by cells in the space, and decreased drainage of fluid from the space. . . Increased amounts of fluid drain from the circulation when there is hypertension in the venous system (creating pressure imbalance) or when there is too little protein in the blood. Ascites (fluid in the peritoneal space, or abdominal cavity) can drain through small perforations in the diaphragm. A large amount of fluid can drain directly into the pleural space this way. . . Abnormal mesothelial cells (as in asbestosis) can produce large amounts of fluid. White blood cells can accumulate in response to infection and inflammation in the pleural space (empyema). These cells produce fluid that is difficult to drain or that are in such large quantities that normal drainage through the lymphatic system simply cannot keep up. . . Malignant tumor cells can migrate (or metastasize) to the pleural space from essentially any type of tumor in the body. These cells can attach to either the visceral or parietal pleural surfaces or float freely in the pleural space and produce large amounts of fluid. . . When tumor cells block lymphatic drainage, fluid accumulates. If the blockage is located in the central lymphatic drainage system that drains chyle (milky fluid consisting of lymph and fat) to the thoracic duct, fluid rich in chyle accumulates in the pleural space",

        "question": "what happens to bees in the winter time?",
        "answer": [
            "According to the bee keepers who posted to the site below:. . The drone bees, whose sole role in life is to inseminate a queen bee, have served their purpose and, with cold weather coming on, their lazy ways and demands for food can no longer be tolerated. They are either driven out to die in the cold or, if they refuse to leave, are killed and carried out by their sisters who are rightly called worker bees.. .  . . Like us, the bees must prepare for the winter ahead and Tandy and I talked mainly about bees and beekeeping in winter.. .  . . Most of the upper hive bodies called \"supers\" where honey is stored were last removed in September, each hive usually giving up between 75 and 100 pounds of honey over the year. (The record for a single hive, Tandy told me, is over 300 pounds but professional beekeeper Sue Hubbell reports that in bad summers her Missouri hives can produce as little as 20 pounds.). .  . . Tandy leaves a several supers for the bees to feed on through the cold weather when outside food sources are not available. Some beekeepers, he told me, take more honey but leave sugar water for the bees to feed on.. .  . . That last honey the bees gathered mostly from our common fall flowers, goldenrods and asters. I read that an early cold snap can crystallize aster nectar and injure the bees carrying it. Tandy's bees feed mostly on goldenrod and he prefers that.. .  . . To defend themselves against cold, the remaining bees gather into a sphere-like area inside the hive. Each bee contributes a small amount of heat to the cluster maintaining the center at 68 degrees. It is colder at the periphery of the sphere but these outside bees elbow their way toward the center after a short time. Thus the mass of about 50,000 bees is constantly rotating. At the same time, as the honey is consumed in one part of the hive the cluster slowly shifts to another.. .  . . Remarkably, in late January the bees will become more active, in this way heating up the interior of their cluster to 86 degrees, enough to allow their queen to begin laying eggs.. .  . . Bees are fastidious housekeepers, but this can cause a problem in winter. They will not defecate in the hive and need occasional warm periods like our January thaws to allow them to make what are called cleansing flights. This can often be a problem for anyone hanging clothes on an outside line. Their sheets would quickly become yellow-spotted. In severe and unrelenting winters the constipated bees become ill and many die.. .  . . Moisture is another problem. Bees produce propolis, a bee glue with which they seal up cracks in the hive wall, but some ventilation must be provided to allow water vapor to escape. When there are deep snows, the heat of the hive will melt the surrounding snow cover but the beekeeper must carefully remove any residue so that water won't enter the hive. Other than that, Tandy said, there is little the beekeeper needs to do in winter.. .  . . Winter is also the best time, he told me, to become a beekeeper. Searching out catalogs, purchasing and preparing hive-building materials and ordering bees for spring should be done now. The Western New York Honey Producers is an active support group in the region but they do not offer instruction. Tandy generously offered to provide initial guidance to interested beginners himself. His Akron phone number is 716-542-9182.. .  . . Since most wild beehives have been lost to disease, we can thank amateur and professional beekeepers for the bees that not only produce honey but also pollinate our plants. We'll see those bees again when the red maples bud and the dandelions bloom early next spring.-- Gerry Rising",

First off, all will agree that the audio in a commercial is generally very loud. 2ndly, when a show \"fades to black\" to go to commercial, both the video and the audio portion are faded down to zero.  So, when the commercial comes on, it sounds like it's much louder than the show you were watching. What you are hearing is the loudness difference between the quiet part of the show fading to black, and the commercial coming on \"balls to the wall\".  Additionally, when the show has a very loud scene going on, like a chase scene, it's no quieter than the commercials. The commercials just \"seem\" louder because of the way human ears work. This can easily be proven using test equipment to measure the peak audio signal during both events."

It is sometimes garnished with a celery stick and is served in a tall glass, often over ice. It is one of the few cocktails traditionally served in the morning, along with the Screwdriver and the Mimosa.. . Bartender Fernand Petiot of Harry's New York Bar in Paris claimed to have invented the drink in 1920. The first citation of \"Bloody Mary\" in the Oxford English Dictionary is from Punch (August 15, 1956): \"Those two … are eating raw steaks and drinking Bloody Marys.\". . . Variants :. .

Petiot says: \"One of the boys suggested we call the drink 'Bloody Mary' because it reminded him of the Bucket of Blood Club in Chicago, and a girl there named Mary.\". . 1927: This is the year that George Jessel claims to have invented the Bloody Mary in his Palm Beach home. He claims the name happened when his friend Mary spilled some of the concoction on her shirt and she said, \"Now, you can call me Bloody Mary, George!\". . 1934: Petiot moves to the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis in New York. His drink becomes popular with New Yorkers but something is missing. The hotel asks him to change the name to the Red Snapper, but it doesn't catch on and it is again called the Bloody Mary. His patrons encourage him to make the drink spicy, so he adds cayenne pepper, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, lemon, and a big dash of Tabasco® sauce. The recipe is a hit.. . March 30, 1956: George Jessel takes out an ad in Collier's that reads: “I think I invented The Bloody Mary, Red Snapper, Tomato Pickup or Morning Glory. It happened on a Night before a Day and I felt I should take some good, nourishing tomato juice, but what I really wanted was some of your good Smirnoff Vodka. So I mixed them together, the juice for body and the vodka for spirit, and if I wasn't the first ever, I was the happiest ever.”. . Aug. 15, 1956: The Bloody Mary is mentioned in Punch magazine: \"Those two ... are eating raw steaks and drinking Bloody Marys.”. . July 18, 1964: Petiot tells the New Yorker: \"I initiated the Bloody Mary of today. George Jessel said he created it, but it was really nothing but vodka and tomato juice when I took it over. I cover the bottom of the shaker with four large dashes of salt, two dashes of black pepper, two dashes of cayenne pepper, and a layer of Worcestershire sauce; I then add a dash of lemon juice and some cracked ice, put in two ounces of vodka and two ounces of thick tomato juice, shake, strain, and pour. We serve a hundred to a hundred and fifty Bloody Marys a day here in the King Cole Room and in the other restaurants and the banquet rooms.\". .

It also houses DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the cell’s hereditary material. The nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear envelope, which protects the DNA and separates the nucleus from the rest of the cell. The nucleus contains most of the cell’s genetic material.. . The nucleus is a dark structure located in the middle of the cell. It controls the cell's activities, and acts like the cell's brain. Inside the nucleus there is DNA which contains genetic information. The cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance inside the cell where most of the cell's activities take place. It's made out of water and other chemicals. All cell parts, except the nucleus, are located in the cytoplasm.. . Kinds of nucleus : . . Bose-Einstein nucleus (2 kinds, 11 facts) - Nucleus of even A-number (i.e., those with integral spin) (cf. Fermi-Dirac nuclei). Bose-Einstein nuclei do not obey the exclusion principle, and their ground state has zero angular momentum. . . deuteron (6 facts) (d) - The nucleus of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. It consists of one proton and one neutron bound together., The nucleus of a deuterium atom. md = 2.01355 amu..  . even-odd nucleus (3 facts) - Nucleus that contain even numbers of protons but odd numbers of neutrons. . . Fermi-Dirac nuclei (2 facts) - Nuclei of odd A-number (i.e., nuclei that do not have integral spin) (cf. Bose-Einstein nuclei). Fermi-Dirac nuclei therefore obey the exclusion principle (q.v.). . . isomer (2 facts) - Nucleus with the same A and Z numbers but in different energy states. . . isotone (2 facts) - Nucleus with the same number of neutrons but with different A and Z numbers. . . isotope (3 facts) - An atomic nucleus having the same number of protons as a more commonly found atomic nucleus but a different number of neutrons. For example, the hydrogen nucleus has a single proton; deuterium has one proton and one neutron and would be called an isotope of hydrogen. (see neutron; proton.), Two nuclei with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are said to represent the same element, but different isotopes. For example, helium-3, with two protons and one neutron in each nucleus, and helium-4, with two protons and two neutrons, are two different isotopes of helium. . . nuclide (2 facts) - A species of atomic nucleus, analogous to the word \"isotope\" for a species of atom. The word is also used to distinguish between atomic nuclei that are in different energy states. . . proton (13 facts) (p) - A subatomic particle with positive electric charge. Every atom has at least one proton in its nucleus; the number of protons determines the element. For example, all atoms with one proton are hydrogen, all atoms with two protons are helium, and so on., One of the constituents of the atomic nucleus. It is a spin-1/2 particle carrying positive electric charge. The proton is the lightest baryon and, as a result, is the particle into which all other baryons eventually decay. It is believed to be absolutely stable, but certain theories (GUTs) predict it will decay very, very slowly., A baryon made of two up quarks and a down quark. It possesses a positive electromagnetic charge and can only be found in atomic nuclei. A single proton is a hydrogen nucleus., A massive particle with positive electrical charge found in the nuclei of atoms. Composed of two up quarks and one down quark.

            "4_3": "DNA contains all of the genetic information necessary to construct cells, to integrate them into an organism and to maintain them. RNA translates this information into specific instructions for the assembly of proteins, transmits the information outside the cell nucleus and helps to assemble them. Each DNA molecule contains hundreds of millions of atoms in a specific and unique sequence. The DNA molecule is shaped like a ladder twisted into a spiral, like a telephone cord. The rungs of the ladder are molecules called nucleotides; the rail of the ladder consists of alternating molecules of sugar and phosphate. There are four nucleotides, each of which is half of a complementary base pair. Each nucleotide fits into its mate on the opposite rail like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. When a cell reproduces a segment of the DNA ladder unzips. The base pairs separate and expose the nucleotides. Each exposed nucleotide attracts its complement from chemicals present in the cell nucleus. The result is two new ladders, each of which is identical to the original. At other times short sections of DNA unzip to expose a certain sequence of base pairs, called a gene. This is where RNA comes in. RNA is similar to DNA in some ways. Nucleotides in RNA are held together by sugars and phosphates. RNA differs from DNA in that each RNA molecule is only a single strand of nucleotides, and is much shorter. An RNA molecule is created by matching the sequence of exposed nucleotides on the unzipped DNA molecule. The RNA is an inverse copy of the gene, like a negative film image. Encoded in it is the information which will be decoded and translated to make the proteins which form the basis of life. Our physical being is an assemblage of thousands of proteins of various types. Structural materials like skin, claws, nails, bones, hair, muscles and the hard bodies of insects and shellfish are proteins. Enzymes are proteins, as are chemicals like insulin and hemoglobin. Proteins are the chemicals of life. The proteins and nucleotide sequence is slightly different for each individual. The types of proteins and the length of DNA are different for each species. But we share with all other people and all other forms of life the same set of amino acids, the same nucleotides and the same genetic code."

Hundreds of instantly cured hiccuper's have sent in their testimony's of deliverance! Files are available for researchers! Carefully understand both the HOW and the WHY of this method. If you don't get the WHY you might not get the HOW. Here's how to cure the hiccups:. . \"Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure\"© 1997. . (1) Pour a TALL glass of water.. . (2) Hold your breath... ***. . (3) IMPORTANT...PINCH YOUR NOSE CLOSED.. . (4) Slowly, take 10 - 20 swallows of the water...while holding your breath with your nose pinched closed.. . (5) When you can't stand it any more....you'll know by that overwhelming drowning sensation -- after a gasp, take a deep breath and relax.. .

(A second treatment could be necessary for stubborn cases.). . *** For stubborn cases, try EXHALING COMPLETELY and then taking 10 - 20 swallows.. . NOW: HERE'S WHY IT WORKS: Hiccups are caused by an uncontrollable spasm in the diaphragm, (the \"breathing\" muscle). Often, this spasm is triggered by irritable conditions in the smooth muscles of the stomach or the esophagus. The \"Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure\" forces an increase in the carbon dioxide levels in the diaphragm itself, as well as in the stomach and esophagus. By swallowing, you are making the muscles work -- so they use up their available oxygen and replace it with carbon dioxide. By temporarily discontinuing to breath, you prohibit new oxygen from entering your body and thus create an anaerobic condition in the spasming diaphragm muscle. When the spasming diaphragm and stomach are deprived temporarily of oxygen and encounter the higher levels of carbon dioxide ... you feel that scary drowning sensation! BUT this causes the spasming muscles to relax! The hiccups go away! Essentially, you are \"tricking\" your body into thinking that it's drowning ... and it decides to use it's resources for something other than hiccuping. The rather \"scary\" drowning sensation caused by this method is NECESSARY for the method to work. If it's not just a little bit difficult ... it doesn't work.",

Plus most people don't say anything about it, so the rude ones get so used to this behavior they don't realize how big of jerks they are being.Try pointing out their rudeness to them sometimes. I was shopping a few weeks ago and a woman asked me if I knew where a certain section was. I told her then she just walked off! I hollered after her that she was welcome. She hesitated and kind of ducked her head, which I think was caused by her realizing how rude her actions were. It may be wishful thinking, but I don't think so. I have no problem pointing out the rudeness of others to them and most become embarassed because they realize exactly how rude they are being. If more people would be nicer, we could bring back politeness. Kill 'em with kindness!!",

        "answer": [
            "Actually, there are a lot of considerations to think about when bringing a bunny indoors.  Personally, I think it is a much better environment for them, but you need to understand that they may not immediately take to your surroundings the way you would like.  Firstly, there is the cage training/litter training thing.  Rabbits are naturally neat creatures and therefore are fairly easy to train.  The key is patience.  Also, if your rabbit has not been spayed, you might want to have this done as it will make potty training easier.  My suggestion is to line a cat litter pan with newspaper, then cover that in hay.  This will give the bunny a reason to go into the pan in the first place, as well as something to dig around in to cover up their \"business\" when they are done.  . . Another important thing to consider is chewing.  Because a rabbit's teeth are constantly growing, they chew to keep them ground down.  Make sure your bun has plenty of safe chew toys to play with.  Mine  love cardboard boxes, telephone books, wooden bird toys, and baby teething keys.  One thing to remember is that wires and the like are often found at floor level, making them a convenient place for a bun to chew.  Not only is this bad for your home electronics, it can give your rabbit a nasty shock too!  Your local electronics store should have some good, sturdy cable wraps to tuck away such temptations.  . . You should also think about restricting your rabbit's access to carpeted areas of the house.  Often rabbits will attempt to graze on carpet, which of course, destroys the rug in question, and can also make the rabbit sick.  Some rabbits never have this problem, and others are seemingly impossible to break from it, so it's all about trying things out with your bun, and seeing what works for you both.  . . If you have any specific questions about bunny training, or keeping house rabbits, feel free to e-mail me (hmelton@sbcglobal.net) anytime.  I currently have 3 sweet little buns living in my house, and have kept indoor rabbits for years.  . . Hope this helps -- and check out the site listed below for some good reading on the subject!",

        "answer": [
            "1. adequate skin hygiene : regular washing,application of an antiseptic agent,effective wiping without causing extensive dryness. 2. regulate or do not alter facial skin pH by using multiple agents, plain soap or combinations (find those cleansing agents that do not irritate or dry ur skin providing u with the sensation of cleaness ) 3. visit the dermatologist so as to determine the quality of the pimple and the intensity (grade and type) of ur acne problem.(u could be asked to use specific rehydrating agents plus antimicrobial agents as acne is due to the obstraction and subsequent inflamation of specific parts of the hair follicle or pores of the skin, usually right above the drainage point of the laterally coexistant sebacuous gland ) common bacterial factors are the propionibacterium, staphyloccoci etc 3. special medication with retinoids or if u are a girl and ur acne problem is big (cystic acne) special medication with contraceptives may be induced 4. after the healing process of ur acne and when u grow at an age tha a future recurrence is minimal, aesthetic measures such as dermabrasion are suggested in case that unwanted spotting or scars have formed",

For example, if a smell is to be recognized and to be kept in memory, nerve impulses from the olfactory tract would travel to the limbic system of the brain; this system is made up of the hippocampus, thalamus, and the amygdala which control a person's memory. When the brain receives an impulse of something that is reoccuring over and over again, it will store it as a memory so it will be remembered.

        "answer": [
            "SIN is not believing the words of the Bible are true, also called unbelief. And sins are what mankind does because we do not believe the Bibles. 1 Corinthians 5:11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. Mark 10:19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. Romans 13:9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.Galatians 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God..  . This is by no means a complete list but all of these are sins, but all a Christian has to do is ask for forgiveness, believe you are forgiven and realize this was why Jesus Christ had to die, for your unbelief in God's word. Realizing you are a sinner by nature, you do not become discouraged by your failing.",
            "Sin is the affect of an earlier problem.Sin occurs mainly after temptation has been acted upon by our spirit and body.Sin is something that if not repented of will lead to death not in the bodily sense alone but spiritual as well.\"The second death\" as it is called is what punishment is aquired for the acummulation of unrepented sin.Actually if a person is baptized into Christ and has repented and living the Christian life as best they can there will still be sin.Thing is we then have the privledge to ask forgiveness of sins as long as we try not to sin which is what repent actually broken down means.To turn from sin.Sin actually is no worse than another sin for instance Christ only really spoke of one and that is blasphemy and it is the worst of all.Sexual sin is a biggy but only because when you are baptized into Christ's body then you have the holy spirit within you.So having sex you are involving the holy spirit which lives inside of you which is definetly not good.Sin for the most part is equal.For instance some so called christians say that homosexuality is worse than other sins but in reality if I looked upon a woman sexually it is no worse than if a man looks at another man that way or vice versa.Just remember that sin is an act not something we are born with as calvinists and catholics believe.A baby that cannot walk talk or have sex cannot sin!Therefore it doesnt need baptism as a baby as they say besides a baby cannot confess Christ as Lord nor repent of sins for it has none.Hope this helps"

The inviting aroma of a juicy roasting bird is enough to make anyone's mouth water, and by the time the chicken emerges from the oven, golden crispy skin sliced through to reveal the tender, moist meat within, everyone will be crazy with anticipation. You don't need to tell them how easy it was to make. Just smile and let them exalt you.. . A Many-Splendored Bird. Roasting a chicken takes a little longer than some other methods of cooking this universally popular bird, but it actually requires very little preparation time-it's mostly just a matter of patience in waiting for the bundle of joy to finish roasting. Another merit of roast chicken is that the leftovers just keep on giving. Roasting two chickens is just as easy as roasting one chicken, and today's roast chicken dinner is tomorrow's chicken enchiladas, chicken soup, chicken salad, chicken fettuccine Alfredo, or chicken sandwich. As if that weren't enough, roast chicken is wonderfully economical, too! Pound for pound, whole chickens are much cheaper than a package of chicken breasts, thighs, or legs.. . Skin is In. Chicken skin contains a great deal of fat, and many people are in the habit of removing it in order to avoid the extra calories. Crispy, fragrant roast chicken skin is absolutely delicious, and, many people insist, the best part of the roast chicken. If you choose to pass up the temptation, though, you still need to leave the skin on the chicken during roasting. Roasting a skinless bird is an exercise in futility. The skin holds in moisture and juiciness. If you skin the chicken before you roast it, the meat will become bone-dry long before it's cooked through. You can carve the chicken then remove the skin from your portion as you see fit. Don't worry-there is no significant difference in calories between removing the skin before or after cooking!. . Divine Brine. One secret to really flavorful, juicy roast chicken is brining-i.e., soaking in salt water. Kosher chickens are always brined before selling; this is one of the reasons that kosher birds tend to taste better. To brine a chicken, dissolve 1/2 cup kosher salt in 1/2 gallon of water, immerse the chicken in the solution and place immediately in the refrigerator. You should let it soak for at least 3 hours, but overnight is great too. When you're ready to cook the chicken, pour out the brine, rinse the chicken cold running water so it won't taste excessively salty, then pat it dry with paper towels. You can still achieve a delicious roast chicken even without brining, but do give it a try sometime. You'll love the results.. . Dress it Up. If you decide to forego the brining step, just remove the chicken from the package, rinse it with cool water, and then pat it dry with paper towels. Rinsing removes residue and some surface bacteria, and drying off the chicken ensures that the skin will brown. Now for the fun part: seasoning! A chicken roasted with nothing but salt, pepper, and butter is very tasty indeed, but it's also easy to build on top of these simple flavors. Herbs are always a good idea. You can chop them up and tuck them under the chicken's skin along with a few pats of butter, or you can simply stuff handfuls of them into the chicken cavity. Wedges of aromatic fruits such as lemons or oranges, and aromatic vegetables such as onions and garlic are great to stuff in with the herbs as well. Filling the cavity with good-smelling things will perfume the bird as it roasts, infusing the meat with incomparable flavor.. . Another approach you can use is to make a blend of dried or fresh ground spices and rub them under the chicken's skin and inside the cavity. For a Southwestern flavor, try chile powder or pureed fresh chiles, cumin, and sage. For an Indian-inspired bird,",

        "answer": [
            "I believe the first step would be to realize that, like Christians, there are many, many different groups that would identify themselves as Muslim.  For example, Jehovah's Witnesses, Catholics, Baptists, and even the Branch Davidians in Waco all would consider themselves to be Christian.  . . Realizing that, you would have to consider which group of Muslims (people) you were trying to understand.  Take a good look at their situation.  Their actions, if they are Muslims, that is to say if they are Islamic, should be supported by, or justified by the Koran (the Holy Book of Islam).  . . I think that some peoples actions, commonly attributed to Muslims or Islam, could also be resulting from other factors.  I have read the Koran (in English) and it is mostly very similiar to reading the Bible in that It is a Message or a lesson from or about God.  Jesus is there and the Virgin Mary, too.  Alot of the same stories or themes,   and God, who is the same are in both Books. There are some parts that would seem wrong or strange or even quite different, but mostly, very similar.",

I like to get the basic training done without all the extra distractions.  Once the basics are installed it is wise to go to different places so that the footing is different.  Like a walk down a side walk, walk them through a carpeted area, bare ground, think forest etc.  Also where people and other animals are so that he/she learns to be observant but will not break her training.. . If you want instructions on how to teach him/her to pull a sled start out with, say a wagon pulling a couple of kids or rocks.  I don't think this is what you were looking for cause you didn't say if you had several or just one.. . I myself like the behavior modification rather than the method training.

            "For other uses, see Mormon (disambiguation).. Mormon is a colloquial term used to refer to adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement, and most commonly to the movement's original and largest group, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The term is derived from The Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith claims to have translated from ancient plates containing a history of the early inhabitants of the Americas that was compiled by a prophet called Mormon. Some mainstream Christian groups consider Mormonism as a cult.",
            "References: Mormon vs Biblical Teachings about Salvation . . . Bible quotations are from the New American Standard version. For information on sources of Mormon quotations, see the section titled \"Mormon Documents\".. . . . 1. Mormons teach that salvation (exaltation) comes through faith in Christ plus baptism plus works, i.e., we must add to the work of Christ. In the Bible 'salvation' means deliverance from the consequence (eternal separation from God) of our sin. Mormon leaders have redefined the word 'salvation' to have a two-fold meaning: a) forgiveness of sins and b) universal resurrection:. . \"There will be a General Salvation for all in the sense in which that term is generally used, but salvation, meaning resurrection, is not exaltation\" (Stephen L. Richards, Contributions of Joseph Smith, LDS tract, p.5). . \"All men are saved by grace alone without any act on their part, meaning they are resurrected\" (Bruce McConkie, What Mormons Think of Christ\", LDS tract, p.28). . Thus, when a Mormon speaks of 'salvation by grace', he is usually referring to universal resurrection. Mormons use the term 'exaltation' to refer to attain a place in the highest level of heaven. The Mormon term 'exaltation' is more nearly equivalent to the Biblical term 'salvation'. What do Mormon leaders say about this?. . The Book of Mormon says of salvation: \"for we know that is is by grace that we are saved, after all that we can do\" (Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 25:23). . The LDS Third Article of Faith states: \"We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel\" (Pearl of Great Price: Articles of Faith). . Joseph Fielding Smith explains what that last phrase means: \"that which man merits through his own acts through life and by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel\" (Doctrines of Salvation, vol. 1, p.134). . James Talmage explains: \"...redemption from personal sins can only be obtained through obedience to the requirement of the Gospel, and a life of good works\" (James Talmage, in A Study of the Articles of Faith). . Spencer W. Kimball states: \"however powerful the saving grace of Christ, it brings exaltation to no man who does not comply with the works of the gospel\" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, pg. 207); \"Each command we obey sends us another rung up the ladder to perfected manhood and toward godhood; and every law disobeyed is a sliding toward the bottom where man merges into the brute world\" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, pg. 153); \"living all the commandments guarantees total forgiveness of sins and assures one of exaltation...trying is not sufficient. Nor is repentence when one merely tries to abandon sin\" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, p.164-165, 354-355). . Bruce McConkie claimed: \"Jesus kept the commandments of his Father and thereby worked out his own salvation, and also set an example as to the way and the means whereby all men may be saved\" (The Mortal Messiah, Vol.4, p.434). . What works do they mean? Here are some:. . Baptism for the dead: \"The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead...Those saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at peril of their own salvation\" (Joseph Smith, in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p.356, 196). . Marriages sealed in the Temple: \"Marriage is not only a righteous institution, but obedience to this law [Temple marriage] is absolutely necessary in order to obtain the highest exaltation in the Kingdom of God\" (Milton R. Hunter, in Gospel Through the Ages, p.119). . Keeping the whole law: \"To enter the celestial [kingdom] and obtain exaltation, it is necessary that the whole law be kept...Do you desire to enter the celestial Kingdom and receive eternal life?"

The reason is this will ammount to no change is that the plan is wrong.  The Bush Administration and millitary brass have put our soldiers into a situation where they cannot succeed.  They can't figure out who is helping and who is the enemy.  This situation could have easily been predicted at the outset of the war with the ethnic make-up of the area and the lack of infrastructure outside of the iron fist of Sadam.  For reasons that are unclear, no one prepared for this kind of war after Sadam was toppled.  I predict we will eventually have Iran 2 for Iraq.  . .

Until 423 there was no \"bible\" or orthodoxy of belief....every little christian group, the Gnostics, Essenes and many others shared different views of who or what Jesus was, and used different versions of Gospels and letters.  . . Constantine ordered that the bishops make a catholic bible (ie broad in interest, appealing to the widest variety )  so they threw out the more contraversial and outrageous bits (and that's saying something !!!) edited and tried to correct inconsistencies with the included bits (and boy, did they miss a lot !!!!) came up with a canon, started persecuting heretic christians and building churches and forging relics with Constantines support.  Phew.. . As the Roman empire collapsed, what was now the Catholic church assumed a power vacuum in Rome and the pope became the de facto ruler of the former Roman Empire.  As literacy level dropped during the Dark Ages, and Latin fell out of common usage, the clergy were the only ones now with \"direct access\" to the word of god, and became incredibly powerful and rich as a result. (Remember, there was no TV back then, and a priest reading gods word to you in a language you didn't understand was a powerful thing). . The Protestant Reformation took place on several fronts with people like Calvin, Luther and Henry VIII reacting to the power and corruption of the papacy.

            "To reach absolute zero, there has to be an object of lower temperature, which could \"steal\" the heat from the cooled object. So, spontaneous reaching of absolute zero is not possible.. . If using a kind of refrigeration, there also has to be a  material that has lower temperature than the cooled one, to get the heat from it.. . Thermodynamically speaking, the second law says that entropy can't go down witout some work applied. To achieve absolute zero, an enormous work would have to be applied, but in working conditions that could disable it (around 0K all motions stop or are extremely slow). On the other hand, every work produces some losses of energy, that are transformed into heat. So, while lowering the temperature, the device would produce some heat, and thus \"denying\" it's own function by rising the temperature.",
            "As the temperature is lowered, the temperature heads more and more towards absolute zero. The third law of thermodynamics states that as temperature approaches more and more towards absolute zero, the system will head towards no entropy. Since a solid has less entropy than water, the liquid water heads to solid at low temperature."

            "4_1": "Absolute zero is important because it is very likely to be the lowest temperate possible, and is most likely unobtainable. Knowing it is useful because it makes calculations involving temperature simple to deal with. Personally I wouldn't want to try anything like quantum thermodynamics using celcius or fahrenheit because the temperatures below zero would most likely turn out to be a lot tougher to deal with.",
            "3_10": "temperature is measured in several measuring methods, farenheit, ceslcius, and kelvin.  high and low are dependent on the presence of molecular motion. only kelvin deals in an absolute temperature. 0 degrees kelvin, is equal to absolute zero. there is no known chemical which has achieved that degree of cold, that I know of, but a chemist may disagree.",
            "2_7": "THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS--. . In thermodynamics, there are four laws of very general validity, and as such they do not depend on the details of the interactions or the systems being studied. Hence, they can be applied to systems about which one knows nothing other than the balance of energy and matter transfer. Examples of this include Einstein's prediction of spontaneous emission around the turn of the 20th century and current research into the thermodynamics of black holes.. . The four laws are:. . Zeroth law of thermodynamics, stating that thermodynamic equilibrium is an equivalence relation. . If two thermodynamic systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. . . First law of thermodynamics, about the conservation of energy . The increase in the energy of a closed system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by heating, minus the amount lost in the form of work done by the system on its surroundings. . . Second law of thermodynamics, about entropy . The total entropy of any isolated thermodynamic system tends to increase over time, approaching a maximum value. . . Third law of thermodynamics, about absolute zero temperature . As a system asymptotically approaches absolute zero of temperature all processes virtually cease and the entropy of the system asymptotically approaches a minimum value. . . This law is more clearly stated as: \"the entropy of a perfectly crystalline body at absolute zero temperature is zero.\"",

From the article, here are some tips:. . 1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer. . . 2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for newly opened businesses, buildings or facilities. Then introduce yourself to the landlords ­ your potential clients ­ and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract. For effective techniques on cold calling, read \"Tips to Successful Cold Calling\"  http://www.powerhomebiz.com/blog/2006/05/tips-to-successful-cold-calling.html. . 3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the facility (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.). . 4. Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the janitorial business. Aside from newly opened buildings, get a list of companies that are downsizing or laying off cleaning staffs.. . 5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a janitorial service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other building owners or entrepreneurs in your area.. . 6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area. . . 7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.. . For detailed information I suggest you read the following books:. . - Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services . - The Janitorial Contractors Bible . - Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business . - Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor . - Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business"

            "Well, if in fact your car was vomitted in, rather than simply smelling like vomit, I would want to know the location of the incident in the vehicle.  If it was primarily in the seats, then what material are your seats?  If they are leather, you are going to need a good scented auto leather cleaner like Touch of Gold.  If the seats are cloth and/or the vomit ended up on the floor, then you will definitely need a heavy duty cleaner and disinfectant.  Lysol will certainly do the trick.  The key is to use as little water as possible, so that you aren't simply spreading it around.  Let it dry completely between cleanings... you should repeat 3 times.  The smell will probably still be there, so it will be a good idea to use carpet fresh just as you would the floors in your home.  Then top it all off with your favorite scent of car air freshener....

If the seats are cloth and/or the vomit ended up on the floor, then you will definitely need a heavy duty cleaner and disinfectant.  Lysol will certainly do the trick.  The key is to use as little water as possible, so that you aren't simply spreading it around.  Let it dry completely between cleanings... you should repeat 3 times.

            "Hi,.  I was taught by a very old lady to think 'ah' instead of saying it. This also slows your speech down which gives the listeners time to take in what you've said.. More useful info on site below",
            "The thing that worked best for me was to record myself giving a speech, and then to play it back to count the times I \"ahh\"'d or \"umm\"'d.  Not only did recording the speech give me practice, but it also provided an opportunity for me to hear how badly my speech sounded when I filled quiet space with meaningless noise.  Once you've listened to yourself take note of the places you add the Ummm's most, and spend some more time studying that area until you know it without a hitch - re-record over and over until you are certain of your material.  Once you know your material, confidence replaces fear, and you'll get through your speech without UMMMMM's."

As you may know Henry Kissinger, US Secretary of State under Presidents Nixon & Ford says \"Oil is much too important a commodity to be left in the hands of the Arabs.---\" . Fact is Oil cant be produced in an unstable country because it is flamable itself and need lots of pipeline to transfer so there must be stable countries in unstable atmosphere.. Middle east has been unstable for many years, USSR and UK has been in territory before WWI and has been replaced by US after that. Israel and Arabs have problems since WWII, Iranians and Arabs have problems even before Islam.... About being poor, apart from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahran, Iran, Iraq, Indonesia, Turkey, Lebonan... there are some poor Islamic countries like Yaman, Afghanestan..... I don't think Islam has been the reason that they are poor, they are mostly countries without resources and good leaders, some of them have been in war since many years ago like Afghanestan.. You can't generalize it, there are many rich Islamic countries and there are poor Islamic countries, you can't say every christian country is rich or every Islamic country is poor.. Proper question is why Islamic countries are not advanced in technology. You can't compare Islamic countries with China, as you know most of resources are in Small countries and they rather buy western cars every year instead of making a automobile factory, you must take it easy on them, you can't force Emarat Arabs to do so, you better know how they are, they even don't explore their oil, western companies do that for them, they don't have an army, western troops protect them, what do you expect of these people? to spend money on science? Do you think its Islam fault?. This is not a problem with Islam, this is a problem with  Muslims, you know that most of Islamic scientist weren't from Saudi Arabia.. You know that science has been emphasized in Islam, there is a Hadith from Mohammad that says \"Learn Sience from cradle to grave\". Like always you have neglected Iran, I have told you, you don't know anything about Iran, there is an Iranian passenger car(Maybe not comparable with BMW but It's not that bad, it can satisfy euro3 standards http://www.ikco.com) and TVs, there are some Iranian TV producers and there are good universities in Iran, they export lots of students each year and we explore our oil ourselves.",

It has two defintions for the word agnostic:. . ag·nos·tic    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (g-nstk). n. . . One who believes that it is impossible to know whether there is a God. . One who is skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism. . One who is doubtful or noncommittal about something. . . adj. . Relating to or being an agnostic. . Doubtful or noncommittal: “Though I am agnostic on what terms to use, I have no doubt that human infants come with an enormous ‘acquisitiveness’ for discovering patterns” (William H. Calvin).",

Theists believe there is a god, atheists are people who aren't theists, they lack that belief. There is nothing in between, you either believe there is a god, or you don't.. . Agnostics are people who have no knowledge of a god.

This is same mistake He made when running for President, going in complete detail instead of giving news bytes. He has probably helped Harold Ford loose TN  due to His remarks as many people are identifying all Democrats to His speech. He has also hurt all Democrats running in the South and border states, many of them have tried to distance themselves with His very liberal views but this will hurt them BAD. The irony of the whole thing is He did fight in Vietnam, He did get purple heart, He has helped get benefits for all Veterans, He does support giving the troops the funds for the materials they need to fight and Bush has put us in a war with no plan of withdrawal, cut veterans benefits, and for months our troops did not have the armored vehicles or even the bulletproof vest for all of them.

While today it is a major issue, in may not be say, if our country were to invade Iran.  While we know what the effects of World War II were, we don't know what the long-term effects of the war in Iraq will be.

That's because too many people will rise up against the book if the authors try to put any personal information in it. For example, when a book says James Buchanan or Martin Van Buren was a bad president, there will be no objections, because they are dead and their parties defunct. If a book says George Bush Sr. was a bad president, there are still people alive to argue against that. Too much stress, so covering recent history broadly is easier for the book publishers.",

I used to work in the service industry and would get frustrated with the ignorance people would hand out rather than a good or at least decent tip. If you can't afford to tip your waiter, waittress, bartender, etc, then maybe you shouldn't go out to eat. Hm. There's a concept. I'll tell you what, since working in the service industry, I have gone to college and now have a great job that I love. I make probably 10 times more money and don't work 10% as hard as I did as a waittress. In my opinion, everyone should have to do 2 things in life. Serve a minimum of 4 years in the military, and wait tables. I have done both. It really sucks that you don't make the money you want, I hope you can either find a better job or figure something else out. Good luck with everything!. . P.S. If I go out and the service is good, I tip at LEAST 20%. And because of this, people remember me and treat me even better next time I come in. Remember this, people, next time you go out to eat!",

Most of the time, I found that the people that tip lousy are the ones that have the money and think that waitressing/bartending is just a lower class job. I disagree. When you are in this type of business, you have to always strive to do your best and not let the lousy tipper get you done even if it is disappointing. As for Streeter Mark, it takes alot more time than 4 minutes to serve a customer. From the time they sit down in your section to the time they leave, if you are any kind of waiter/waitress, you will be attentive to your customers until they leave that table. Even if it means just refilling water or coffee, or if they engage you in a conversation, not just being short with them. You need to be personable and be able to anticipate the customers needs before they ask for it. That does take a little bit of brains to do so. And by the way, being a server of any kind is not a degrading job, at least that person is working and not mooching off the system and if it wasn't for them, you wouldn't have a restaurant or a bar to go to since there wouldn't be anyone to serve you. You go bartender and do your thing and you'll get the good tippers and the bad too. Take it with a grain of salt and just do your job well. By the way, I tip on the quality of service I get. i.e.- if I have to ask for my drink to be refilled, or to have the dishes removed, etc.",

I honestly think it might work.. . Failing the \"little buggers\" doesn't work.  They don't care.. . One of the biggest problems is that a lot of parents have memories of bad school experiences.  They absolutely hate the thought of going into a school.  It makes them feel stupid.. . Also we have a lot of parents who really don't consider education as something they need/needed and don't think it will do anything for their children either.  It isn't something they value.. . Out school has tried raffling off DVD players, computers, all kinds of things.  They just had to come to school and each time they would get to fill out a raffle ticket.  It didn't help.

It deals with the life force inside you, the goal is to open the \"symbolic third eye\" but one should only attempt that when one is emotionally stable, by which you have addressed the most painful issues in your entire life.. Successful meditation will open a flood gate of emotions.. . . Engery leaks out the body when Mediation is not done right. The goal of certain types is to cycle the engery witout escaping throughout the seven centers. Sleepyness happens because of engery escaping or bad concentration."

            "\"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" (1 John 1:9). . While my opinion is probably only one of many, I believe that if we confess our sins, it is like an admission that we know we have done wrong, and we can acknowledge and accept that we need to be forgiven for a given act, thought or deed.  To me, it's like an addict finally being able to admit openly that he or she has a problem, and by making such admission, we are more open to accept the assistance that is needed.  In the instance of confessing of a sin, we are admitting that we are not perfect, and we know that we falter, and we need intervention and guidance in order to live a more spiritual life.",
            "I think confession encourages Christians to commit more sins since they know they can do what ever they like to do then just confess and all sins are erased, besides if Jesus died for their redemption why to waste time in such scandals? This is one of Christianity absurdities."

When we Die we will stand before God and be Judged, not by a preist, only God and us. when we stand before God if we are Guilty he will punish us. How can he Forgive Us?. . Let me explain by asking you a few questions.............. . . Have you ever lied (even once--fibs, white lies, etc.)? Ever stolen (anything--the value is irrelevant)? Jesus said, \"Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart.\" Have you ever looked with lust? If you have said \"Yes\" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we’ve only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. Nothing you’ve ever done is hid from His holy eyes. Will you be innocent or guilty on the Day of Judgment? Listen to your conscience. You know that you will be guilty, and therefore end up in Hell. That’s not God’s will. He provided a way for you and I to be forgiven. . He sent His Son to take our punishment: \"God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\" He was bruised for our iniquities. Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. . Your own so-called “goodness” can’t get you into heaven any more than mine could.  Jesus is the only way to Heaven. He is the \"Door,\" the only \"mediator.\" There is salvation in no other name, so pray something like this: \"Dear God, I repent of all of my sins (confess them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. Please forgive me and grant me your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus’ name I pray. Amen.\""

Modern celebration of \"Christmas\" is more about fellowship and love of friends and family than it is about Christ's birth.  (That and the crass commercialization of the season.)  If we focus on appreciating and loving our fellow man and woman during that season - regardless of faith, race or station - I think we honour all people celebrating and that Jesus would be proud.. . So don't be ashamed of celebrating Christmas because you are not of the Christian faith.  Exchange reasonable and thoughtful gifts with loved ones..  Spend time with friends, family and make a special effort to see those without family nearby.  Celebrate being alive.. . Peace & Love,. RXZ",

Sorta like the Brits don't celebrate the 4th of July, to them, it's just another day.  So if you are truely hard on your beliefs, you should volunteer to work on Christmas, you shouldn't be doing anything else. . . Try telling that to your kids someday.  \"Sorry dear, we don't believe in God and Jesus, so you don't get any presents like all your friends\".  That one will be fun."

Many suicides are the result of mental disorders in which the person has no real control over what they are doing. In this case, the person is not so much a suicide victim as a victim of the disease they were fighting. Again, these are general statements, no one can judge a particular instance other than God himself."

Repentance is truly being sorry and never wanting to commit more sin, especially the same ones over and over.  . . That said, if you have Christ as your savior, you eventually walk with Him to the point of not wanting to sin against anyone you love, anyone...especially Christ.  Furthermore, if you do get to heaven and stand in the presence of the Lord, you must account for every idle word, and deed.  Do you want to sit and give excuses to the One who saved you and gave you eternity with Him in a place that will be beyond your greatest dreams?. . You do not have to be bad to go to hell, just lost and deceived.  In my opinion, also scared or lazy.  It is scary at first to give up the life you know in this fallen world and it seems easier to just go on in ignorance of the gift He offers.  Neither option is better than just giving up what this world offers, because in the end you have pain and disappointment either way, and with Jesus, you are never alone.. . So ask yourself, why do I want to get away with...whatever it is you want to experience.

The marquis was fond of a particularly exotic Mediterranean dish that, at the time, was taking the French aristocracy by storm-live gerbil. This dish was traditionally prepared by shaving the gerbil and brushing it with a light coating of olive oil and spices. The diner would then pick up the entire gerbil and stuff it into his/her mouth, the olive oil providing lubricant. However, in the Marquis' case, he was a long-time sufferer of halitosis, so much so that when his Greek manservant, Alexopolous, tried to drop the gerbil into the Marquis's mouth, it would writhe and wriggle in disgust at the fetid stench rising from his throat. Alexopolous, exhibiting a shrewdness known to the Greeks, had the idea of placing a few pieces of greens into the Marquis' mouth in order to entice the gerbil into his mouth. Voila! Success for the Marquis, and, over time, the creation of a delicious and satisfying dining tradition for all of us in the west.",

Then you added a lot of different subjects to improve US and Israel actions against the whole of world.. . US invading and occupying other countries by some nonsense excuses including, Human-rights, Democracy, etc. But what's fact?. I think, oil, gas, control over some strategic places and all of these matters are just for US benefits.. . What's about Israel?. Israel is country that founded on some false history and they (Zionists) founded it on a lot of dead Palestinians bodies. They occupied Palestine from 60 years ago till now. Israelis are killing innocent unarmed people in their mother land and their homes.. . You said, why are human rights groups obsessed with Israel.. I say you, they can't do anything against of barbarism and murdering in Palestine. Sometimes they protesting against a few ordinary subjects.. We watching children, women who killed and wounded by Israeli soldiers and Israeli militias everyday. YES, EVERY DAY. But they don't issue these kind of news completely. They censored news and pretend to Palestinians are attacking Israelis. Imagine this is right, just imagine...!. Palestine is Palestinian's land and they have right to live there freely and have job opportunities, etc, but Israelis just offering them bullets and bombs in their lands, of course with supporting by US.. . Also, you mixed Iran matters with Israel and US. This is so interesting...!. Iran wants to achieve out its rights to make some nuclear power stations under \"IAEA\" inspects. also, Iran wants to have some new technologies.. Perhaps you pretent to Iran has worse human-rights feature in compare with US and Israel.. I should mention you above notes again and again.. Actually, all of countries have some problem about human-rights matters. But Iran's matters isn't equal with some invaders, occupiers, bullies countries like US and Israel.. . If you are seeing the world and rights in your side, this is good opportunity to hearding other ideas.. Also, don't worry about human-rights obsessing. They just show you some nonsese theatres, they won't do anything against your favorite countries, So don't worry."

        "answer": [
            "Tricky question.  The Holocaust was an awful event in human history, but the bigger event at the time was World War II, that literally involved every corner of Earth.  Jewish people or anyone do not take offense but the WAR had greater repercussions than the Holocaust itself - here's why.... Estimates are that 6 million Jews were exterminated, worked to death, murdered in Europe.  The end state was that Jews created Israel in 1948.. Now compare the number of Chinese, Russian (and Slavs of Eastern Europe), German, French, Japanese that died totaling in the hundreds of millions.. The Holocaust was spurned by a decision of the Nazis to rid Europe of Jews as quickly as possible.  This decision (arguably) didn't have a huge bearing on how the Allies would fight the war and defeat Germany and Japan (unconditional surrender from the beginning).. Comparisons - how many tribes/people did Ghengis Khan crush rolling through out of the Asian steppe?  How many north African tribes (originally from Europe) were wiped out by invading Arabs in the early Middle Ages?  How many Chinese did good 'ole Mao kill or starve to death in the 1960s?  How many Russians and Soviets died under glorious Stalin over a thirty year reign? (Both killed more people than Hitler). My point is that no matter in what conflict, humans have always reached some level of absolute barbarism and lose total value in human life (more recently the Khomer Rouge (sp?) in Cambodia, Milosevic in former-Yugoslavia, Saddam in Iraq/Iran and today, Darfur).  . Unfortunately, there aren't many positive LONG term effects to make much difference after human atrocities occured.  At least not many difference makers that have been successful.  The SHORT term goals are usually very good - criminal trials of the accused, memorials/museums to the deceased/fallen.  . Bottom Line - World War II resulted in many global changes, lessons to be learned from the Holocaust have largely been forgotten...Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, China (over decades since), sub-Saharan Africa (Rwanda, Somalia, Darfur), Yugoslavia, former-USSR, Iran/Iraq War, etc etc...human atrocities will likely continue...",

A J Ayer, & the Gettier counter-examples, the basis for modern thought into knowledge itself (well worth a read, espeacially the Gettier counter-examples to Justified True Belief. Not hard to find, it's the only paper he ever published).... . The list is endless. Just don't start off with Wittgenstein. If you start with him, & he becomes your basis for philosophical writing, you'll find it hard motivating yourself to read philosophy.",
            "Wittgenstein is not the first philosopher you should read. there are others whose contribution is more basic to the subject as well as easier to understand. These include Descartes, Locke, Hume and Mill. Amongst Wittgenstein's contemporaries they include Russell and Quine. In addition, Ryle's book \"The Concept of Mind\", published just before Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\", is also highly influential as an argument aginst \"The ghost in the machine\", and is much more readable.. . Having placed Wittgenstein in context, his work is essential reading if you are to understand twentieth century philosophy, particuarly the philosophy of mind and of language, both of which have been crucial for twentieth century advances in thought. This applies both to Wittgenstein's earlier work, the \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" with its picture theory of truth and the \"Philosophical Investigations\" which overturned Wittgenstein's earlier ideas with the notion of the language game.. . Wittgenstein is difficult to read, or rather to understand. You will need to read one, and probably several, of the many introductions to his works before approaching his main texts, and it will greatly help to go to lectures and/or tutorials on Wittgenstein. One reason is that Wittgenstein believed that philosophical works should stand on their own merit, and as a consequence the influence of previous philosophical thought on his work, for instance Augustine, Frege and Russell, is not always obvious.. . A further issue is that Wittgenstein's own ideas gave rise to a belief that the philosopher's personal life is irrelevant to his (or her) thought This belief has been followed by many more recent philosophers, but in Wittgenstein's own case it is very problematic. Wittgenstein's own life was remarkable in many ways, and deeply tortured. It may have led to inluences on his work that neither Wittgenstein nor his interpreters fully appreciate or wish to admit if they do. For this reason I would strongly suggest that you read the standard biography, \"Wittgenstein\" by Ray Monk, before or alongside your philsophical reading on Wittgenstein."

It is all really a choice and sometimes it is very hard, but when I look back on my life and some of the people who I love today, I have to admit had I not of taken the approach I did I would of missed out on some fantastic friendships. Some of my friends really were annoying and drove me crazy, but like I said they are great once I got to know them. Too often people tend to have preconcieved notions about someone or a race and instead of finding out for themselves they just continue on with that un fortunatly they really miss out.

Here is what Abraham Lincolon said on the subject:  . . \"For too long, every ounce of forgiveness I owned was locked away, hidden from view, waiting for me to bestow its precious presence upon some worthy person. Alas, I found most people to be singularly unworthy of my valuable forgiveness, and since they never asked for any, I kept it all for myself. Now, the forgiveness that I hoarded has spouted inside my heart like a crippled seed yielding bitter fruit. . No more! At this moment, my life has taken on new hope and assurance. Of all the world’s population, I am one of the few possessors of the secret to dissipating anger and resentment. I now understand that forgiveness has value only when it is given away. By the simple act of granting forgiveness, I release the demons of the past about which I can do nothing, and I create in myself a new heart, a new beginning.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive even those who do not ask for forgiveness.. . Many are the times when I have seethed in anger at a word or deed thrown into my life by an unthinking or uncaring person. I have wasted valuable hours imagining revenge or confrontation. Now I see the truth revealed about this psychological rock inside my shoe. The rage I nurture is often one-sided, for my offender seldom gives thought to his offense!. . I will now and forevermore silently offer my forgiveness even to those who do not see that they need it. By the act of forgiving, I am no longer consumed by unproductive thoughts. I give up my bitterness. I am content in my soul and effective again with my fellowman.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive those who criticize me unjustly.. . Knowing that slavery in any form is wrong, I also know that the person who lives a life according to the opinion of others is a slave. I am not a slave. I have chosen my counsel. I know the difference between right and wrong. I know what is best for the future of my family, and neither misguided opinion nor unjust criticism will alter my course.. . Those who are critical of my goals and dreams simply do not understand the higher purpose to which I have been called. Therefore, their scorn does not affect my attitude or action. I forgive their lack of vision, and I forge ahead. I now know that criticism is part of the price paid for leaping past mediocrity.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive myself.. . For many years, my greatest enemy has been myself. Every mistake, every miscalculation, every stumble I made has been replayed again and again in my mind. Every broken promise, every day wasted, every goal not reached has compounded the disgust I feel for the lack of achievement in my life. My dismay has developed a paralyzing grip. When I disappoint myself, I respond with inaction and become more disappointed.. . I realize today that it is impossible to fight an enemy living in my head. By forgiving myself, I erase the doubts, fears, and frustration that have kept my past in the present. From this day forward, my history will cease to control my destiny. I have forgiven myself. My life has just begun.. . I will forgive even those who do not ask for forgiveness. I will forgive those who criticize me unjustly. I will forgive myself.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit.\"",

In fact, early Christians often took Wiccan traditions and incorporated them into early Christianity. In later Christianity, the Roman Catholic church was not pleased that more people were not turning to Christianity and decided to demonize the Wiccan religion. A coven of witches consisted of (and still consists of) 13 members...1 priestess or priest and 12 members. The Catholic church deemed the number 13 unlucky in order to frighten more people away from this nature-loving religion of Wicca. . . What's ironic is the \"forgotten\" books of the Bible...the Apocrypha...make many allusions to adopted Wiccan principles and practices in early Christianity...how many churches now include the Apocrypha!?",

If it is the cat peeing/pooping in your room and not the litter box, then I would suggest several items.  Is this more than once?  Are they spayed/neutered?  (If not, they should be).. . First, have him/her checked by a vet. You will want to rule out any physical problems such as a UTI or other issues. Is he neutered? (If not, that raises a different series of physical causes).. . Second, you need to remove 100% of the odor from the area he urinated. Just because you can't smell it doesn't mean they can't! Pets stores sell special cleaners such as natures miracle to help with this.. . Assuming it is physical, address that issue with your vet.. . If it is not physical, ask yourself has anything changed? . . Did you move the litter boxes? Did you change the brand of litter? Are the litter boxes still in a fairly attractive area for the cat(and well away from their food/water)? Does the cat feel safe?  (I have heard all sorts of stories about this -- people not figuring out that: leaving the boxes in the basement with no lights at all; placing a dog crate next to the cat box; putting the cat box next to the cat food, etc. are all bad ideas). . . Have you added any new people or pets to the household? Have you changed your routine a great deal. Put simply, cats hate change!. . You also might want to restrict access to that room except when you are present. That can help prevent the problem -- and would help determine the cause.. .

            "Ok. A SERIOUS answer to your question (not just an opinion of your dog licking you) If it is a constant licking (like almost obsessive) it is a sign of being territorial...in a sense. There are a few ways to fix this. For one, when they lick you without your invitiation, a snap on the nose and a firm NO might get the point across. . Train him to lick you on command. When he licks you, say \"good boy, gimme kisseys\" or whatever you want. When you dont give the command and he licks you, tell him no. This will give him the idea of when it's right and when its wrong.. Also, a good idea would be to put him in submissive position, because obsessive licking does have a tendency to be territorial. Submissive position, if you're unaware, is something they do in dog packs where the Alfa (you) challanges the lower (your dog) by putting him on his back and staring into his eyes until he looks away. when you do this, keep a firm pressure on his chest. Since hes a bigger dog, you might need your knee. Do this until he calms and looks away, even if he cries. YOu might even notice how he will listen to you more after this. All your doing is telling him that you are the boss, and he has to do what you say. DOnt worry...This happens in dog packs all the time. It wont hurt him; your just thinking like him :D . good luck!"
