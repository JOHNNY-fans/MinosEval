            "Coolant IS the more proper term.  Ethylene glycol and, more recently propylene glycol do both perform as anti-freeze, but only when the temperature is below 32 degrees F.. . But whenever your engine is up to operating temperature the mixture in the cooling system performs as coolant.  The obvious task is to cool the engine and carry the heat to the radiator.  But another overlooked function of either of the glycols is to help raise the boiling point of the water.  Remember in science class...anything added to water like that will lower freezing point and also raise boiling point as well.  The pressure cap on the radiator keeps the pressure at from 7 to 15 p. s. i. which increases the boiling point as well.  That way all your water will not boil away quickly.",
            "The difference is, coolant is the liquid that curculates through your engine and radiator to cool the engine. Anti freeze is a component of most but not all coolants.Diesel engines use a special antifreeze called Dow Therm. Suzuki motorcycle engines use oil in their engine cooling systems in some of their road bikes like the Intruder line. Auto motive antifreeze must not be put in your cooling system by itself.It is made to be mixed with water to work properly.I usually mix it 50/50 which will protect from freezing to -40 F."

Just so happens that for every form of matter, colder means heavier which means more density. . . If cold air is denser then it weighs more given the same volume of hot air. So in weighing more, the cold air will fall rather than rise. . . So in making a freezer with the freezing compartment at the top is just a form of efficiency. The motor has to do less work in disposing of the cold air. When it is released gravity does the rest of the job and pulls it downwards while the warmer air rises.. . That's why at super markets freezers look like pools because they keep cold air in which does not rise but keeps hot air out which would not settle down low."

Petiot says: \"One of the boys suggested we call the drink 'Bloody Mary' because it reminded him of the Bucket of Blood Club in Chicago, and a girl there named Mary.\". . 1927: This is the year that George Jessel claims to have invented the Bloody Mary in his Palm Beach home. He claims the name happened when his friend Mary spilled some of the concoction on her shirt and she said, \"Now, you can call me Bloody Mary, George!\". . 1934: Petiot moves to the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis in New York. His drink becomes popular with New Yorkers but something is missing. The hotel asks him to change the name to the Red Snapper, but it doesn't catch on and it is again called the Bloody Mary. His patrons encourage him to make the drink spicy, so he adds cayenne pepper, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, lemon, and a big dash of Tabasco® sauce. The recipe is a hit.. . March 30, 1956: George Jessel takes out an ad in Collier's that reads: “I think I invented The Bloody Mary, Red Snapper, Tomato Pickup or Morning Glory. It happened on a Night before a Day and I felt I should take some good, nourishing tomato juice, but what I really wanted was some of your good Smirnoff Vodka. So I mixed them together, the juice for body and the vodka for spirit, and if I wasn't the first ever, I was the happiest ever.”. . Aug. 15, 1956: The Bloody Mary is mentioned in Punch magazine: \"Those two ... are eating raw steaks and drinking Bloody Marys.”. . July 18, 1964: Petiot tells the New Yorker: \"I initiated the Bloody Mary of today. George Jessel said he created it, but it was really nothing but vodka and tomato juice when I took it over. I cover the bottom of the shaker with four large dashes of salt, two dashes of black pepper, two dashes of cayenne pepper, and a layer of Worcestershire sauce; I then add a dash of lemon juice and some cracked ice, put in two ounces of vodka and two ounces of thick tomato juice, shake, strain, and pour. We serve a hundred to a hundred and fifty Bloody Marys a day here in the King Cole Room and in the other restaurants and the banquet rooms.\". . Jan. 8, 1975: Petiot dies in San Francisco.. . 1976: The McIlhenny Company introduces Tabasco® Bloody Mary Mix.",

A rare but potentially life-threatening disease, rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated strep throat, caused by bacteria called Group A Streptococcus.

These initial symptoms can last from one to three days before the more intense symptoms of the illness begin. The more common intense symptoms include:. . a severe sore throat, . fever, and . swollen glands (lymph nodes) in the neck area. . It is generally the severe sore throat that prompts people to contact their doctor. . . What are the signs of \"mono?\" . . In addition to a fever from 102 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, the most common signs of \"mono\" are:. . a very reddened throat and tonsils and . swollen lymph glands in the neck. . The tonsils have a whitish coating in at least one third of the cases. The spleen, (sometimes referred to as the body's biggest lymph node), is an organ found in the left upper abdomen underneath the ribcage which becomes enlarged or swollen in about 50% of patients with \"mono.\" An enlarged liver may also occur. About 5% of patients have a splotchy red rash over the body, which has a similar appearance to the rash of measles. . . How is \"mono\" diagnosed? . . The diagnosis of \"mono\" is suspected by the doctor based on the above symptoms and signs. \"Mono\" is confirmed by blood tests while testing to exclude other possible causes of the symptoms. Early in the course of the illness, blood tests show an increase in a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte). Some of these increased lymphocytes are unusual or \"atypical\" lymphocytes, which suggest \"mono.\" More specific testing, such as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests, can confirm the diagnosis of \"mono.\" These tests rely on the body's immune system to make measurable antibodies against the EBV. Unfortunately, the antibodies may not become detectable until the second or third weeks of the illness. A blood chemistry test can reveal abnormalities in liver function. Testing to exclude the possibility of a strep throat is also considered for some patients."

        "question": "what is the term milky way?",
        "answer": [
            "Milky Way, the galaxy of which the sun and solar system are a part, seen as a broad band of light arching across the night sky from horizon to horizon; if not blocked by the horizon, it would be seen as a circle around the entire sky. Although its motion is not readily apparent, the entire galaxy is rotating about the Milky Way's center. Relative to the universe, the galaxy is moving at a speed of c.370 mi per sec (c.590 km per sec) in the same direction that the constellation Leo lies relative to the earth; it is also moving at c.60 mi per sec (c.100 km per sec) relative to the center of mass of the local group of galaxies. The sun, traveling at a speed of c.150 mi per sec (c.240 km per sec) in a nearly circular orbit, takes 200–230 million years to complete one revolution.. Visual Characteristics of the Milky Way. . Among the constellations the Milky Way passes through are Carina, Crux (the Southern Cross), Sagittarius (where it is brightest), Scorpius, Aquila, Cygnus, Perseus, Cassiopeia, Auriga, and Gemini. In the direction of Cygnus is the Great Rift, a band of dark matter that lies along the Milky Way, dividing it into two forks. Another dark region is the Coalsack, in Crux. Once believed to be vast empty regions in space, these dark areas are now known to be clouds of dark matter blotting out the light behind them. Such nonluminous clouds of dust and gas, called dark nebulae, obscure many parts of the sky from sight; in the direction of the galactic center, the view is almost entirely obscured.. . Size and Shape of the Milky Way. . The Milky Way is a large galaxy comprising an estimated 200 billion stars (some estimates range as high as 400 billion) arrayed in the form of a disk, with a central elliptical bulge (some 12,000 light-years in diameter) of closely packed stars lying in the direction of Sagittarius. It is surrounded by a flat disk marked by six spiral arms—four major and two minor—which wind out from the nucleus like a giant pinwheel. Because of these arms, the Milky Way was classified as a spiral galaxy. However, increasing evidence indicates that the Milky Way probably has a bar or barlike structure of new, bright stars in its central region. This would modify its classification to a barred spiral or an intermediate type between barred and “normal” spiral. Our sun is situated in one of the smaller arms, called the Local or Orion Arm, that connect the more substantial next inner arm and the next outer arm. The sun lies roughly two thirds of the way from the center of the disk, which is some 28,000 light-years distant, and in the galactic plane. When we look in the plane of the disk we see the combined light of its stars as the Milky Way. The diameter of the disk is c.100,000 light-years; its average thickness is 10,000 light-years, increasing to 30,000 light-years at the nucleus.. . Certain features of the region near the sun suggested that our galaxy resembles the Andromeda Galaxy. In 1951 a group led by William Morgan detected evidence of spiral arms in Orion and Perseus. Another bright arm stretches from Sagittarius to Carina in the southern sky. With the development of radio astronomy, scientists have extended a nearly complete map of the spiral structure of the galaxy by tracing regions of hydrogen that dominate the spiral arms.. . Surrounding the galaxy is a large spherical halo of globular star clusters that extends to a diameter of about 130,000 light-years; this is called the stellar halo. The galaxy also has a vast outer spherical region called the corona, or dark halo, which is as much as 600,000 light years in diameter and, in addition to dark matter which accounts for most of the Milky Way's mass, includes some distant globular clusters, the two nearby galaxies called the Magellanic clouds, and four smaller galaxies.. . Stellar Populations and Galactic Evolution. . The stars, gas, and dust that make up the Milky Way can be grouped into two broad stellar populations that suggest",

            "accumulation of fluids in the lungs",
            "Pleural effusion is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space  as a result of excessive transduction or exudation from the pleural surfaces. . Pleural cavity contains normally less than 20 ml of fluid.  . Tuberculosis is the commonest cause  and effusion is due primarily to hyper sensitivity reaction to tuberculous protein."
        ],
        "response": {
            "4_7": "Fluid that accumulates in the pleural space because of trauma or disease is called pleural effusion. This condition may result from heart failure, cancer, pulmonary embolism, or inflammation. If blood is in the accumulating fluid, the condition is called \"hemothorax\"; if pus is present, it is called \"empyema\"; if air enters the space, it is called \"pneumothorax\"; and if there is chyle (milky fluid consisting of lymph and fat), it is called \"chylothorax.\" There are two types of pleural effusion, transudative and exudative. . . An imbalance between the venous-arterial pressure and the pressure within the pleural space (oncotic pressure) causes transudative effusions. Transudates contain few protein cells and little solid material content and have a clear, pale yellow color. Cardiac failure and, less commonly, liver and kidney disease cause transudative pleural effusion. . . Exudative effusions are caused by inflammation, infection, and cancer. Exudates have large amounts of protein cells, white blood cells, and immune cells that have migrated into the pleural fluid and deposited in tissues or on tissue surfaces. Exudates also are pale yellow in color but have a cloudy appearance. If pus is present because of infection (empyema), the fluid is yellow, cloudy, and has a foul odor. Pneumonia, tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism (blocked pulmonary artery), cancer, and trauma are common causes of exudative pleural effusion. . Mechanisms of Pleural Fluid Accumulation . An excessive amount of pleural fluid probably results from a combination of fluid draining into the tissues from the blood vessels and the overproduction of fluid by the mesothelial cells. Fluid accumulates in the pleural space by three mechanisms: increased drainage of fluid into the space, increased production of fluid by cells in the space, and decreased drainage of fluid from the space. . . Increased amounts of fluid drain from the circulation when there is hypertension in the venous system (creating pressure imbalance) or when there is too little protein in the blood. Ascites (fluid in the peritoneal space, or abdominal cavity) can drain through small perforations in the diaphragm. A large amount of fluid can drain directly into the pleural space this way. . . Abnormal mesothelial cells (as in asbestosis) can produce large amounts of fluid. White blood cells can accumulate in response to infection and inflammation in the pleural space (empyema). These cells produce fluid that is difficult to drain or that are in such large quantities that normal drainage through the lymphatic system simply cannot keep up. . . Malignant tumor cells can migrate (or metastasize) to the pleural space from essentially any type of tumor in the body. These cells can attach to either the visceral or parietal pleural surfaces or float freely in the pleural space and produce large amounts of fluid. . . When tumor cells block lymphatic drainage, fluid accumulates. If the blockage is located in the central lymphatic drainage system that drains chyle (milky fluid consisting of lymph and fat) to the thoracic duct, fluid rich in chyle accumulates in the pleural space",

        "answer": [
            "A mental illness in which the person suffers from distorted thinking, hallucinations, and a reduced ability to feel normal emotions.. . . one of the most complex of all mental health disorders; involves a severe, chronic, and disabling disturbance of the brain. . . A mental disorder lasting for at least 6 months, including at least 1 month with two or more active-phase symptoms.

A psychotic disorder characterized in the active phase by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thoughts/speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, and apathy.. . . .....There's a lot more too...",
            "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric diagnosis that describes a mental disorder characterized by impairments in the perception or expression of reality and by significant social or occupational dysfunction. A person experiencing untreated schizophrenia is typically characterized as demonstrating disorganized thinking, and as experiencing delusions or auditory hallucinations.. . Although the disorder is primarily thought to affect cognition, it can also contribute to chronic problems with behavior and emotion. Due to the many possible combinations of symptoms, heated debate is ongoing about whether the diagnosis necessarily or adequately describes a disorder, or alternatively whether it might represent a number of disorders. For this reason, Eugen Bleuler deliberately called the disease \"the schizophrenias\" plural, when he coined the present name.. . Diagnosis is based on the self-reported experiences of the patient, in combination with secondary signs observed by a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist or other competent clinician. No objective biological test for schizophrenia exists, though studies suggest that genetics, neurobiology and social environment are important contributing factors. Current research into the development of the disorder often focuses on the role of neurobiology, although a reliable and identifiable organic cause has not been found. In the absence of objective laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis, some question the legitimacy of schizophrenia's status as a disease. Furthermore, some question the status of schizophrenia as a disease on the basis that they do not consider the condition to be an impairment.. . The term schizophrenia translates roughly as \"shattered mind,\" and comes from the Greek σχίζω (schizo, \"to split\" or \"to divide\") and φρήν (phrēn, \"mind\"). Despite its etymology, schizophrenia is not synonymous with dissociative identity disorder, also known as multiple personality disorder or \"split personality\"; in popular culture the two are often confused. Although schizophrenia often leads to social or occupational dysfunction, a predisposition toward aggressive behavior is little associated with the illness."

        "question": "If the econ is so great why is the savings rate negative?",
        "answer": [
            "There is no real correlation between two.  . . The fact is people want what they cannot afford, so they borrow to live beyond their means.  Materialism has its price, and for most, it is way too high.. . The real disaster is going to occur later when the spenders need to keep earning money into old age and will never be able to retire (if anyone is still willing to employ them).  Can you say \"lower standard of living.\"",
            "The savings rate is negative because people are living beyond their means. Back in 1933 when the US Government developed Social Security, it was announced as a supplimental income and citizens were asked to save at least 10% (15% reconmended) from each paycheck into some form of investment to be used for retirement. People didn't listen, but we had a Baby Boom which caused a population growth. Social Security was designed as a pyramid sceme to have the younger taxpayers support the retired ones. Not that many people lived to the age of 65 or 70 to collect Social Security back in 1933. In the 1960's the liberals forced birth control and abortion on the culture and society of the USA, which slowed down the population birth and stopped the Baby Boom. This caused a problem because that Social Security pyramid was now upside down due to a decrease in population births thanks to birth control and abortion, and thanks to medical advances people were living to the age of 65, 70, 80, 90, ect. This put a drain on the Social Security system and the US economy. It got worse in the 1980's 1990's as Baby Boomers begain to retire. The economy might crash in 2015 when the last of the Baby Boomers start to retire and the Social Security system will be paying out twice as much as it bring in with taxes.. . The negative savings has to do with Baby Boomers retiring and cashing in their stocks, IRAs, 401Ks, and other investments. It was starting to be felt in 1999 when the Dotcom companies and technology companies fell. The economy took a tumble in 1999 due to these factors. I myself lost $50,000 in savings in 1999 due to those economic factors making my IRA worth less money. 2000 started to get worse, and in 2001 we had a war going on, 2003 another war, deficit spending stimulated the economy a bit, but the savings rate took a hit.. . Materialism is partly to blame, people keep buying things to keep up with their neighbors. A failing health insurance system is to blame as well, as most bankrupcies are caused by high medical bills. Liberalism is partly to blame for forcing birth control and abortion on the population, causing a reverse Baby Boom, meaning fewer births. High gas prices are partly to blame, as it eats into people's savings. There are other factors as well.. . The economy is great, because it is a consumer driven economy. The more things people buy, the stronger the economy grows. The problem is that hardly anyone is saving, and most people are borrowing money to live on. Most people live paycheck to paycheck and cannot even follow a budget. Good for banks, good for businesses, good for the government that taxes them all, but bad for the consumer who now owes more money than before. Only people are selling stocks, instead of buying them, which is driving down income for most businesses as their stocks lower in value and they cannot raise capital. There are two ways a business can turn a profit, cut expenses or increase revenues. Since everyone is spending beyond their means, increasing revenue is not possible. So they stick to cutting expneses, like wage cuts or downsizing, in order to turn a profit for shareholders. If managers cannot turn a profit for shareholders, the shareholders will vote in new managers."

        "response": {
            "4_7": "Thats because people are spending instead. The reason they are spending is because of increased borrowing thanks to still existant low interest rates. Interest rates are low because the money supply is relatively large thanks to the FED's sales of treasury bonds, a monetary policy which allows us to stimulate economic growth by expanding our money supply and therefore offer low interest rates. Our large money supply has also contributed to the devaluation of the dollar (along with some inflation and an ever increasing trade defecit), encouraging foreign countries (especially China) to buy more treasury bonds from the FED, therefore floating us the money to further expand our money supply and keep interest rates down, even though the more bonds we sell, the greater out government debt (to China) since bonds are pretty much governmnet IOUs. . . In the long run, remember that the money people save is the same money banks use to lend out to borrowers. Without bond sales by the FED, the lack of savings in banks will shrink the pool of availiable money (excess reserves) banks have for loans. They will respond by raising interest rates. Investors will borrow less at higher interest rates. As costs increase, firms will cut production, people will be laid-off, and spending will once again decline with savings experiencing a rebound. Recession will return and be gone when increased savings has helped expand the pool of loanable funds, interest rates lower, and investment is attractive again. This is the buisiness cycle, an inevitable by-product of capitalism.. . By the way, I'm an AP Macroeconomics teacher. :)",

So, when the commercial comes on, it sounds like it's much louder than the show you were watching. What you are hearing is the loudness difference between the quiet part of the show fading to black, and the commercial coming on \"balls to the wall\".  Additionally, when the show has a very loud scene going on, like a chase scene, it's no quieter than the commercials. The commercials just \"seem\" louder because of the way human ears work.

Astronauts strap themselves to bike machines and excerize for hours daily when in space to maintain at the same health they'd be if they were on Earth not excercizing at all. If they fail to keep their muscles and bones active, they can experience painful damage to the muscles and even early signs of osteoperosis, the deterioration of bone mass that people on earth experience when they don't have enough calcuim, which can lead to injuring the bone. However, the excercise is easily enough done that maintaining gravity inside spacecraft is not an issue.",

If a person could not say the Lord's prayer perfectly, they were thought to be possesed by the devil, and thus, a witch.",
            "The events which led to the Witch Trials actually occurred in what is now the town of Danvers, then a parish of Salem Town, known as Salem Village. Launching the hysteria was the bizarre, seemingly inexplicable behavior of two young girls; the daughter, Betty, and the niece, Abigail Williams, of the Salem Village minister, Reverend Samuel Parris.  .      . The Witch House  In February, 1692, three accused women were examined by Magistrates Jonathan Corwin and John Hathorne. Corwin's home, known as the Witch House, still stands at the corner of North and Essex Streets in Salem, providing guided tours and tales of the first witchcraft trials. John Hathorne, an ancestor of author Nathaniel Hawthorne, is buried in the Charter Street Old Burying Point.   .    By the time the hysteria had spent itself, 24 people had died. Nineteen were hanged on Gallows Hill in Salem Town, but some died in prison. Giles Corey at first pleaded not guilty to charges of witchcraft, but subsequently refused to stand trial. This refusal meant he could not be convicted legally. However, his examiners chose to subject him to interrogation by the placing of stone weights on his body. He survived this brutal torture for two days before dying. . It is remarkable 552 original documents pertaining to the witchcraft trials have been preserved and are still stored by the Peabody Essex Museum. . . Eerie memorabilia associated with the trials, such as the \"Witch Pins\" used in the examination of witches and a small bottle supposed to contain the finger bones of the victim George Jacobs can be found there as well. .     .   *These short paragraphs are intended only as an introduction to a complex subject about which much has been written.  .

The Salem Witch Museum , the Witch Dungeon Museum and The Witch History Museum take you back in history to 1692, yet, present-day popularization of the witchcraft hysteria doesn't reveal anything about the large number of modern Witches living in Salem today. . The Salem Witch Village, where people can learn the facts about Witchcraft, is highly recommended by many members of the Salem Craft Community. The goal is to promote religious tolerance and participation in a positive society that encourages growth and acceptance of all its people. .  . .

The world, redeemed from superstition's sway, .

From June through September of 1692, nineteen men and women, all having been convicted of witchcraft, were carted to Gallows Hill, a barren slope near Salem Village, for hanging. Another man of over eighty years was pressed to death under heavy stones for refusing to submit to a trial on witchcraft charges. Hundreds of others faced accusations of witchcraft. Dozens languished in jail for months without trials.  Then, almost as soon as it had begun, the hysteria that swept through Puritan Massachusetts ended. .     Why did this travesty of justice occur? Why did it occur in Salem? Nothing about this tragedy was inevitable. Only an unfortunate combination of an ongoing frontier war, economic conditions, congregational strife, teenage boredom, and personal jealousies can account for the spiraling accusations, trials, and executions that occurred in the spring and summer of 1692. . .

        "answer": [
            "DNA contains all of the genetic information necessary to construct cells, to integrate them into an organism and to maintain them. RNA translates this information into specific instructions for the assembly of proteins, transmits the information outside the cell nucleus and helps to assemble them. Each DNA molecule contains hundreds of millions of atoms in a specific and unique sequence. The DNA molecule is shaped like a ladder twisted into a spiral, like a telephone cord. The rungs of the ladder are molecules called nucleotides; the rail of the ladder consists of alternating molecules of sugar and phosphate. There are four nucleotides, each of which is half of a complementary base pair. Each nucleotide fits into its mate on the opposite rail like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. When a cell reproduces a segment of the DNA ladder unzips. The base pairs separate and expose the nucleotides. Each exposed nucleotide attracts its complement from chemicals present in the cell nucleus. The result is two new ladders, each of which is identical to the original. At other times short sections of DNA unzip to expose a certain sequence of base pairs, called a gene. This is where RNA comes in. RNA is similar to DNA in some ways. Nucleotides in RNA are held together by sugars and phosphates. RNA differs from DNA in that each RNA molecule is only a single strand of nucleotides, and is much shorter. An RNA molecule is created by matching the sequence of exposed nucleotides on the unzipped DNA molecule. The RNA is an inverse copy of the gene, like a negative film image. Encoded in it is the information which will be decoded and translated to make the proteins which form the basis of life. Our physical being is an assemblage of thousands of proteins of various types. Structural materials like skin, claws, nails, bones, hair, muscles and the hard bodies of insects and shellfish are proteins. Enzymes are proteins, as are chemicals like insulin and hemoglobin. Proteins are the chemicals of life. The proteins and nucleotide sequence is slightly different for each individual. The types of proteins and the length of DNA are different for each species. But we share with all other people and all other forms of life the same set of amino acids, the same nucleotides and the same genetic code.",

The rings and piston will scorch if you get it super hot, otherwise, you only comprimise the integrity of the head.  It may also have a warped head.  Is it aluminum?  If so, it's most likely warped.  If it's a 2.3 with a cast iron head (not the shiny one), then just pull the head, intake, and exhaust out together and check it thouroughly.  Look closely between the valves.  The clean combustion chamber will be the one that's sucking water.  Good luck.",

The best way to find out IMO is a compression check of all cylinders, if you are getting normal compression in all but one cylinder, or adjacent cylinders then its a good chance the head is warped. If compression is low across the board I would suspect the gasket itself, but either way if you pull of the head you might as well send it to a machine shop to get it pressure tested and resurfaced if necessary."

The poison enters the food chain and carries on killing.. Buy traps, bait them with chocolate or gravy on a piece of bread and leave them against the walls and skirting.. If you use the live box traps you have to release the mice about a mile from your house or they come back. Mice can also freeze or starve to death in them so check them every morning.",
            "If you are seriously looking for a humane way to rid your house of mice, the only option is live traps. These catch the mice inside a box-like structure so you can release them elsewhere, preferably somewhere far from any houses. People usually have mixed results with these. You could also just get regular spring mouse traps. They usually kill the animal instantly, by breaking their spinal cord. Just be sure to check them often.. You also need to understand how the other methods work in order to pick the right one. Rat poison doesn't cause dehydration, but instead it causes internal bleeding, until the animal eventually dies. MAKE SURE TO KEEP THIS AWAY FROM PETS OR LIVESTOCK-- THEY WILL AFFECT THEM THE SAME WAY. and treatment is expensive.  Glue traps work by trapping the animal and waiting for them to starve to death or dehydrate. Can also be harmful for pets. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me."

This causes a characteristic 'hiccup' sound and the spasms can repeat continuously for several minutes.\" . There are various cures, sometimes contradictory, ranging from holding your breath to breathing deeply and slowly, to drinking upside down. See this website for a description of various cures. Hope that he-cup-lps!",

The best way to do this, is to take a glass of water, place the edge of the glass between your teeth, take a sip, breathe in, take a sip, breathe out, take a sip, breathe in, take a sip breathe out, slowly for a few minutes until your hiccups go away."

It is very difficult to identify especially in the young age. One striking difference is almost all gold fish scales are very shiny and koi may be colourful but not so shiny. The second important feature is Koi will grow very fast but gold fish comparatively low. The caudal fin of Koi always will be simple but gold fish mostly it is fan like. When you are selecting very small fishes, this can be easily noticed.If you need only gold fish select those have fan type caudal fin. Koi colour patches are not soo unique and attractive like gold fish but except the variety calico most of the gold fishes have definite and attractive patterns.Koi is ideal only for garden pools but gold fish can be from small indoor tanks to garden pools. Koi's basic stucture is very similar to Common carp and doenot have a pot belly similar to gold fish, Koi is more or less spindle shape with longer body than caudal fin but gold fish especially if they are young, caudal fin length is equal to the body length except in one or two cases. Gold fish body width wlll come down immediately after the stomach and form tail. But koi posterior part slowly narrow down to have a caudal peduncle to form a simple tail. I hope it may be clear now."

That Jonathan Bush’s Riggs Bank has been found guilty of laundering terrorist funds and fined a US-record $25 million must embarrass his nephew George, but it's still no justification for leaping to paranoid conclusions.. . That George Bush's brother Marvin sat on the board of the Kuwaiti-owned company which provided electronic security to the World Trade Centre, Dulles Airport and United Airlines means nothing more than you must admit those Bush boys have done alright for themselves.. . That George Bush found success as a businessman only after the investment of Osama’s brother Salem and reputed al Qaeda financier Khalid bin Mahfouz is just one of those things - one of those crazy things.. . That Osama bin Laden is known to have been an asset of US foreign policy in no way implies he still is.. . That al Qaeda was active in the Balkan conflict, fighting on the same side as the US as recently as 1999, while the US protected its cells, is merely one of history's little aberrations.. . The claims of Michael Springman, State Department veteran of the Jeddah visa bureau, that the CIA ran the office and issued visas to al Qaeda members so they could receive training in the United States, sound like the sour grapes of someone who was fired for making such wild accusations.. . That one of George Bush's first acts as President, in January 2001, was to end the two-year deployment of attack submarines which were positioned within striking distance of al Qaeda's Afghanistan camps, even as the group's guilt for the Cole bombing was established, proves that a transition from one administration to the next is never an easy task.. . That so many influential figures in and close to the Bush White House had expressed, just a year before the attacks, the need for a \"new Pearl Harbor\" before their militarist ambitions could be fulfilled, demonstrates nothing more than the accidental virtue of being in the right place at the right time.. . That the company PTECH, founded by a Saudi financier placed on America’s Terrorist Watch List in October 2001, had access to the FAA’s entire computer system for two years before the 9/11 attack, means he must not have been such a threat after all.. . That whistleblower Indira Singh was told to keep her mouth shut and forget what she learned when she took her concerns about PTECH to her employers and federal authorities, suggests she lacked the big picture. And that the Chief Auditor for JP Morgan Chase told Singh repeatedly, as she answered questions about who supplied her with what information, that \"that person should be killed,\" suggests he should take an anger management seminar.. . That on May 8, 2001, Dick Cheney took upon himself the job of co-ordinating a response to domestic terror attacks even as he was crafting the administration’s energy policy which bore implications for America's military, circumventing the established infrastructure and ignoring the recommendations of the Hart-Rudman report, merely shows the VP to be someone who finds it hard to delegate.. . That the standing order which covered the shooting down of hijacked aircraft was altered on June 1, 2001, taking discretion away from field commanders and placing it solely in the hands of the Secretary of Defense, is simply poor planning and unfortunate timing.

            "Actually, there are a lot of considerations to think about when bringing a bunny indoors.  Personally, I think it is a much better environment for them, but you need to understand that they may not immediately take to your surroundings the way you would like.  Firstly, there is the cage training/litter training thing.  Rabbits are naturally neat creatures and therefore are fairly easy to train.  The key is patience.  Also, if your rabbit has not been spayed, you might want to have this done as it will make potty training easier.  My suggestion is to line a cat litter pan with newspaper, then cover that in hay.  This will give the bunny a reason to go into the pan in the first place, as well as something to dig around in to cover up their \"business\" when they are done.  . . Another important thing to consider is chewing.  Because a rabbit's teeth are constantly growing, they chew to keep them ground down.  Make sure your bun has plenty of safe chew toys to play with.  Mine  love cardboard boxes, telephone books, wooden bird toys, and baby teething keys.  One thing to remember is that wires and the like are often found at floor level, making them a convenient place for a bun to chew.  Not only is this bad for your home electronics, it can give your rabbit a nasty shock too!  Your local electronics store should have some good, sturdy cable wraps to tuck away such temptations.  . . You should also think about restricting your rabbit's access to carpeted areas of the house.  Often rabbits will attempt to graze on carpet, which of course, destroys the rug in question, and can also make the rabbit sick.  Some rabbits never have this problem, and others are seemingly impossible to break from it, so it's all about trying things out with your bun, and seeing what works for you both.  . . If you have any specific questions about bunny training, or keeping house rabbits, feel free to e-mail me (hmelton@sbcglobal.net) anytime.

Most of these \"gangsters\" represent excitment and action.  The gangsters might be throwing money around and those girls prefer to be around guys who have money.  Girls want a manly man and a guy that is dangerous.  It all goes back to the excitment theory.  Also, girls want a man that is strong and full of confidence.  Some \"sweet\" guys are often shy and are willing to allow a woman to run all over them.  Even though some women might like that power, but overall, most women want a man that can be a leader and not a follower.  It is a double edged sword.  We want a powerful sweatheart.  That is just rare to impossible.  So, yes, girls are stupid....but men are stupid also.  Why are you guys so attracted to the beautiful bitchy girls that run all over you and treat you like crap?

All I can say is, be stubborn like the dogs you are trying to protect.  Petition again, publicly protest, anything legal to tell your city that this is wrong.

They can however, cause more damage than most dogs once an attack begins. Actually, for initiating an attack, usually for no apparent reason, the toy breeds are the worst. This animal takes a special kind of person for an owner, a person willing to make sure the animal is well trained and socialized. This entire problem is not the fault of the dogs, but of the people and what they have done and not done with these dogs.. .

Almost always obedient, it is always eager to please its master. It is an extremely courageous and intelligent guard dog that is very full of vitality. Highly protective of his owners and the owner's property, it will fight an enemy to the death. It is usually very friendly, but has an uncanny ability to know when it needs to protect and when everything is okay. The American Pit Bull Terrier can be willful and needs a firm hand. They are generally okay with other pets if they are raised with them from puppy hood.  For the most part they are very friendly, but not recommended for most people.

            "Sin is the affect of an earlier problem.Sin occurs mainly after temptation has been acted upon by our spirit and body.Sin is something that if not repented of will lead to death not in the bodily sense alone but spiritual as well.\"The second death\" as it is called is what punishment is aquired for the acummulation of unrepented sin.Actually if a person is baptized into Christ and has repented and living the Christian life as best they can there will still be sin.Thing is we then have the privledge to ask forgiveness of sins as long as we try not to sin which is what repent actually broken down means.To turn from sin.Sin actually is no worse than another sin for instance Christ only really spoke of one and that is blasphemy and it is the worst of all.Sexual sin is a biggy but only because when you are baptized into Christ's body then you have the holy spirit within you.So having sex you are involving the holy spirit which lives inside of you which is definetly not good.Sin for the most part is equal.For instance some so called christians say that homosexuality is worse than other sins but in reality if I looked upon a woman sexually it is no worse than if a man looks at another man that way or vice versa.Just remember that sin is an act not something we are born with as calvinists and catholics believe.A baby that cannot walk talk or have sex cannot sin!Therefore it doesnt need baptism as a baby as they say besides a baby cannot confess Christ as Lord nor repent of sins for it has none.Hope this helps",

Note: you don't have to teach a kid to lie, you have to teach a kid NOT to lie. It is our nature to sin as lying is a sin. So, He came down, made Himself a man and was crucified so that we might live. He rose again on the 3rd day to show us that He would come again for us. There is a reason to live a true, Holy repentant life as He is alive and He will come back for His people. Those that do not choose to believe this way will be punished the Bible says by living in eternal damnation, Hell. Those that choose life and believe will be saved. How to be saved? Acts 2:38 clearly gives a path:. 1. Repent- tell God you are sorry for your sins. 2. Be baptized in JESUS name- not the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost it must be in HIS name. 3. Receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  This is evidence that you have received Jesus Christ into your heart as you will speak with other tongues as the spirit gives utterance. .

The fuel acts a little differently, so the car you use it in need to be capable of handling the different fuel charge. Generally, these high ethanol content fuels burn cleaner then the normal gasoline, but the heating value of the mix is lower, so you don't get as much energy out of the fuel (use more fuel).

Some manufacturers these days are favoring the turbocharger because it is \"free energy\" since it runs off the exhaust gases where as a supercharger usually runs off the serpentine belt in effect making the engine work harder than it would without the supercharger.

Anxiety is a complex combination of the feeling of fear, apprehension and worry often accompanied by physical sensations such as palpitations, chest pain and/or shortness of breath. It may exist as a primary brain disorder or may be associated with other medical problems including other psychiatric disorders.. . 2) Depression:. Depression (mood)  . Depression, in everyday language, refers to any downturn in mood, which may be relatively transitory and perhaps due to something trivial. This is differentiated from clinical depression which is marked by symptoms that last two weeks or more and are so severe that they interfere with daily living.. In the field of psychiatry the word depression can also have this meaning but more specifically refers to a mental illness when it has reached a severity and duration to warrant a diagnosis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) states that a depressed mood is often reported as being: \"... depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or 'down in the dumps'.\". .  Depression (geology)  . Depression in geology is a landform sunken or depressed below the surrounding area. Depressions may be formed by various mechanisms, and may be referred to by a variety of technical terms.. . Depression (economics)  . In economics, a depression is a term commonly used for a sustained downturn in the economy. It is more severe than a recession (which is seen as a normal downturn in the business cycle). Considered a rare but extreme form of recession, the start of a depression is characterised by unusual increases in unemployment, restriction of credit, shrinking output and investment, price deflation or hyperinflation, numerous bankruptcies, reduced amounts of trade and commerce, as well as violent currency devaluations. Unlike a recession, there is no official definition for a depression, even though some have been proposed. Generally it is marked by a substantial and sustained shortfall of the ability to purchase goods relative to the amount that could be produced given current resources and technology (potential output). One could say that while a recession refers to the economy \"falling down,\" a depression is a matter of \"not being able to get up.\" . . Depression (meteorology)  .

There are training classes everywhere you look if you want to do in that kind of setting to were there are a lot of distractions of other dogs and other people around.  I like to get the basic training done without all the extra distractions.  Once the basics are installed it is wise to go to different places so that the footing is different.  Like a walk down a side walk, walk them through a carpeted area, bare ground, think forest etc.  Also where people and other animals are so that he/she learns to be observant but will not break her training.. . If you want instructions on how to teach him/her to pull a sled start out with, say a wagon pulling a couple of kids or rocks.  I don't think this is what you were looking for cause you didn't say if you had several or just one.. . I myself like the behavior modification rather than the method training.

            "well let's say that the real thing is why don't you prove what you are saying is true which it's not It seems to me you have not researched the so called facts you state as you may have thought.   Parts of Noahs Ark have been sighted on Mount Ararat and bits of tarred gofer wood which the Ark was made from have been dated and found to be 5000 years old,this is proof that the bible is true, and there is more; Look at the Moabite Stone.The original can be seen in the Louvre Museum in Paris France. The writing tells of the rebellion of King Mesha of Moab against Israel. This  event is also reported in the Bible (2 Kings1:1:3:4-27) The Pool of Siloam and the entrance of a 1,749 foot  -long(533 meter-long)water tunnel in Jerusalem. Many modern-day visitors to Jerusalem have waded through this tunnel. It's existance is further proof that the Bible is true, The Bible explains that King Hezekiah had this tunnel built over2,500 years ago to protect his water supply from an invading army,-(2Kings20:20; 2Chronicles32:2-4,30)At the British Museum a visitor can see the Neabonidus Chronicle. It describes the fall of ancient Babylon, even as the Bible also does.(Daniel5:30,31)The Bible says that Belshazzar was then King of Babylon.  In fact, at one time all known writings said that Nabonidus was Babylon's last king. So some who said the Bible is not true claimed that Belshazzar never existed and that the Bible was wrong. But in recent years ancient writings have been found that identified Belshazzar as a son of Nabonidus and coruler with his father in Babylon at the time. Yes, the Bible really is true, as so many examples prove.Yet the Bible does not contain only true history.Everything it says is true, Even when it touches on matters of science, it is marvelously accurate. These are only some examples, but the more research you do the more you will see the truth of the Bible.",

            "4_4": "References: Mormon vs Biblical Teachings about Salvation . . . Bible quotations are from the New American Standard version. For information on sources of Mormon quotations, see the section titled \"Mormon Documents\".. . . . 1. Mormons teach that salvation (exaltation) comes through faith in Christ plus baptism plus works, i.e., we must add to the work of Christ. In the Bible 'salvation' means deliverance from the consequence (eternal separation from God) of our sin. Mormon leaders have redefined the word 'salvation' to have a two-fold meaning: a) forgiveness of sins and b) universal resurrection:. . \"There will be a General Salvation for all in the sense in which that term is generally used, but salvation, meaning resurrection, is not exaltation\" (Stephen L. Richards, Contributions of Joseph Smith, LDS tract, p.5). . \"All men are saved by grace alone without any act on their part, meaning they are resurrected\" (Bruce McConkie, What Mormons Think of Christ\", LDS tract, p.28). . Thus, when a Mormon speaks of 'salvation by grace', he is usually referring to universal resurrection. Mormons use the term 'exaltation' to refer to attain a place in the highest level of heaven. The Mormon term 'exaltation' is more nearly equivalent to the Biblical term 'salvation'. What do Mormon leaders say about this?. . The Book of Mormon says of salvation: \"for we know that is is by grace that we are saved, after all that we can do\" (Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 25:23). . The LDS Third Article of Faith states: \"We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel\" (Pearl of Great Price: Articles of Faith). . Joseph Fielding Smith explains what that last phrase means: \"that which man merits through his own acts through life and by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel\" (Doctrines of Salvation, vol. 1, p.134). . James Talmage explains: \"...redemption from personal sins can only be obtained through obedience to the requirement of the Gospel, and a life of good works\" (James Talmage, in A Study of the Articles of Faith). . Spencer W. Kimball states: \"however powerful the saving grace of Christ, it brings exaltation to no man who does not comply with the works of the gospel\" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, pg. 207); \"Each command we obey sends us another rung up the ladder to perfected manhood and toward godhood; and every law disobeyed is a sliding toward the bottom where man merges into the brute world\" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, pg. 153); \"living all the commandments guarantees total forgiveness of sins and assures one of exaltation...trying is not sufficient. Nor is repentence when one merely tries to abandon sin\" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, p.164-165, 354-355). . Bruce McConkie claimed: \"Jesus kept the commandments of his Father and thereby worked out his own salvation, and also set an example as to the way and the means whereby all men may be saved\" (The Mortal Messiah, Vol.4, p.434). . What works do they mean? Here are some:. . Baptism for the dead: \"The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead...Those saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at peril of their own salvation\" (Joseph Smith, in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p.356, 196). . Marriages sealed in the Temple: \"Marriage is not only a righteous institution, but obedience to this law [Temple marriage] is absolutely necessary in order to obtain the highest exaltation in the Kingdom of God\" (Milton R. Hunter, in Gospel Through the Ages, p.119). . Keeping the whole law: \"To enter the celestial [kingdom] and obtain exaltation, it is necessary that the whole law be kept...Do you desire to enter the celestial Kingdom and receive eternal life?",

Heroic soldiers execute with pefection a plan to track down and eliminate Zarqawi.  Despite this perfect execution, it will not ammount to much change  in Iraq.  40 people were killed and 120 people wounded yesterday despite the actions against Zaraqawi.  . . The reason is this will ammount to no change is that the plan is wrong.  The Bush Administration and millitary brass have put our soldiers into a situation where they cannot succeed.  They can't figure out who is helping and who is the enemy.  This situation could have easily been predicted at the outset of the war with the ethnic make-up of the area and the lack of infrastructure outside of the iron fist of Sadam.  For reasons that are unclear, no one prepared for this kind of war after Sadam was toppled.  I predict we will eventually have Iran 2 for Iraq.  . . It is wonderful that they got Zarqawi, unfortunately it will hardly put dent in the violence.  It might not even chip the paint.",

Now, that the sentiments are largely against Iraq - they have switched gears and denounce anything \"evil\"",

I've heard time and again it was for WMD's and then sometimes I hear it's because of an Al Qaida connection. Which is it? We wouldn't have an issue if we were told the truth and they were honest with us. There is nothing but backhandedness going on in that White House and look who you're quoting...fox news. Yeah they're balanced...sure they are. There are plenty of republicans out there that are also fed up with the lies that this administration has told us. It's not a matter of whether or not Kerry won...that's done and over with. I haven't heard too many people complaining about Kerry not winning until I listen to people like you. I'm aware of the article Rolling stone did about the \"voting problems\" in Ohio. Maybe you should read that and then make an informed decision. And another thing...why is it ok for us to make WMD's (even though we're not supposed to) and no one else is allowed? I'm not saying I want them to be made but if we signed an agreement which we did, shouldn't we be following it too?

Some STDs infect your sexual and reproductive organs. Others can cause general body infections. Sometimes you will have symptoms caused by the STD infection, while other times the symptoms may be so mild that you don't even notice that you have the STD. . Either way, you have the STD until you have been medically treated.  STDs can occur again and again because immunity can not usually be built up and there are no vaccinations against them.  The consequences of untreated STDs can be sterility, blindness, and even death!  .  . check out the web site",

Remember, what makes the news is generally an isolated case, but it has been generalized to sound like common practice. At the same time, there are many different educational systems and criteria that it is hard to make comparisons. For example, as a general rule, most US universities will not consider a candidate for a Master's program if the Bachelor's was completed in less than 4 years. Countries that follow the British educational style will have spent a period of \"pre-university\" that can take up to 2 years before taking the final exams for the chosen papers. Then, completion of a Bachelor's degree takes only 3 years. To compare with the American system, we have the general education subjects before specialization tends to occur. In effect, bith systems are doing the same thing, it's a hang up about the time factor or classification of an area with which most are not familiar.. . Another idea to help keep in mind, for professional types of degrees and qualifications, each country has specific ideas as to what should be in the curriculum. For example, medical schools also empasize patient care and communication as part and parcel. Other countries medical degrees take less time as they empasize more on pathology and diagnosis. . . One more thing to remember, in the US we don't have a national standard. The US universities are independent and may not even accept credits from another US university. Many universities DO offer bridging programs where should you not meet the tradtitional requirements for a master's degree, you can apply your experience as well as take a few subjects you lack to re-evaluate your situation. Thos means you won't have to repeat everything - just fill in the gaps in your education that do not meet the standards of a particular university.",

The High Church or Anglo-Catholic faction is almost identical in dogma and worship as their Roman Catholic cousins and though many regard the Pontiff with affection, do not regard Him as having any authority over them (though it doesn't stop them copying and adopting every known Roman Catholic practise!)Contrary to the questioner, most High Church membership is concentrated in the South and West of England..

Knowledge is a broad category of all of the truths that a person can intellectually understand. I see wisdom as the smaller set of psychological or philosophical truths that one has gained, usually through experience. Wisdom is the knowledge of uncommon truth(s) that directly influences one's thoughts, feelings, and actions.. . I guess I believe this because of how frequently the word \"wise\" is associated with an old person who acts and thinks differently than other people because he has a greater understanding of the nature of things around him.

        "answer": [
            "Heat is vibration of particles, but the catalyst for making those particles vibrate can be many things, from friction to chemical. One such catalyst, light, is constantly passing through almost every area of the universe at all times, and when this light impacts matter, heat results. However this heat is irrelevant to our conversation, because your asking about empty space (which is almost impossible to find and/or create). The fact is this:. How do we know the temperature of an area of space, or more accurately how far from absolute zero it is, without introducing some piece of matter that is designed to determine the information we seek? The introduction of such a device would receive impacts from the light passing through said space field, corrupting the temperature reading.. The point of this is that empty space does have a temperature close to ab zero (not ab zero due to dark energy radiating heat), empty space is an improbable eventuality, and if it did or does ever happen no-one will be there to observe it. besides that, space is not empty and thus is not ab zero. . as a side note, particles are a vibration of impure energy, and are only seen because the energy is moving at the speed of light giving the illusion that it is material. Therefore, even matter is just space that is not empty, and thus is not ab zero.",
            "Its near absolute zero, at about 3 kelvin. This is some of the only evidence that the Big Bang happened, because it is theorized that the slight temperature is energy left over universe wide from the explosion. Otherwise, it would be absolute zero...theoretically."

We call these molecules heat molecules. If the molecules slow down, stuff gets colder. That's why scientists can make the temperature one millionth of a Kelvin (a temperature scale) away from Absolute Zero. At absolute zero, nothing moves. No movement. Nothing.. . This is why when molecules heat up, it becomes faster because there is more energy. If molecules went fast enough, something might just burn. This is how we have the sun and fire and heat. . .

Absolute zero has very specific thermodynamic properties - it is the temperature where atoms have the minimum molecular vibration, which defines heat.  It's too complicated to describe here - suggest you check the reference.. . Anyway, looking at temperatures from absolute zero, all temperatures are positive.  Also, every element (and compound) has its own thermodynamic characteristics, including melting point, boiling point, and freezing point.  So Fluorine has a boiling point that is 85.15 degrees above absolute zero, water has a boiling point that is 373.15 degrees above absolute zero, and iron (for example) has a boiling point that is 3134 degrees above absolute zero.. .

Make sure there is absolutely no way air can get to it.. remove it after 7 days and check to see if the wart is still there, if so repeat for another 7 days with fresh tape and aspirin. If you're allergic to aspirin then skip it and wait 14 days before unwrapping the tape.. . Another remedy that wors better and doesn't make you look silly for a week.. is find a man who is the 7th son (meaning he has 6 older brothers) and have him 'rub away' the wart. All he has to do is rub his thumb over the wart for a few seconds.. when you forget about it, it'll be gone.. .   My two oldest boys had gotten warts all over their hands and I had a 7th son rub them off. About 6 weeks later, I had forgotten about it and went to take the boys to the doctor to get rid of them before school started, and the youngest one's warts were gone. The oldest didn't believe they'd be gone and they weren't but the youngest did believe. It really works. Another thing is go to your doctor and ask him or her to use crushed up blister beetle on the wart, it'll go away in about a week. Good luck"

Fat loss comes with overall body loss--so if you are chubby to begin with, you lose arm fat and lower leg fat before you lose fat on your waist, hips, and thighs. If you are skinnier to begin with, you lose fat on your torso--stomach, waist--since the other fat is already gone. The key to getting a six pack, thus, is to do lots of cardio (given you already have plenty of muscle.) Stripping the fat away, you will reveal your abs. Also--eating right is just as important, if not important, than simply hitting the gym. Building a killer body is about 30% gym and 70% nutrition."

Unless you the QURAN now includes a chapter where it claims Muslims MUST be happier than all the others, in which case i'd bend to Allah's will and would accept the view. We all know he's always Right.. In the meantime, could you pass on your question to the following groups of muslims?. . a) Muslims gays in all middle eastern countries, with particular reference to Turkey, Egypt, Syria and Iran?. b) All women in Middle Eastern countries, except Jordan, Lebanon, and a few others. c) Did you know in some African countries muslims adopted the non muslim practice of Infibulation, consisting in the surgical removal of the clitorid of women in order to deprive them from any source of sexual pleasure? The practice is done by an older woman without any specific tool, they just pull and cut.. d) Did you know that in other muslim countries they adopted the practice of sewing the vaginal lips always for the same reason, and that many of those women leave their country and have to undergo painful surgical interventions after that thraumatic experience?. g) did you know muslim immigrants still kill their daughters or sisters when they don't marry the men their parents tell them to marry. (see Germany, Turkey, Paksitan and several other places or simply check AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL). Did you know they burn their women to punish them or that they take them in the squares of their towns and kill them by lapidation with the participation of the whole citizenship?. h) Did you know in Saudi Arabia there is one of the highest rates of paedophilia?. i) Did you know muslims have one of the highest rates of homosexuality?. h) Did you know the highest number of rapists in Europe is made up of Muslims, which is even sadder if you consider their are still a minority in many countries?. If that's called happiness then i wonder what is to you unhappiness.. Good luck mate and God Bless you and your ideas(whoever he is)"

And the Geezers felt the same way towards those who preceeded them, and on back through history...even the great philosophers of antiquity pondered the generational differences.  We're talking guys who lived, thought and wrote thousands of years ago, yo!. . It's primarily biological.  Human animals are programmed to be ferociously competitive simply to survive, as we once had to do right after we climbed down outa the trees and began walking upright.  Oaky, yeah, we had to be tough before then, too...the \"out of the trees\" is just an imperfect analogy.  Anyway, it's built in.  Younger hunters/warriors had to push the older guys out of the way whenever the older guys began to slow down in their reaction times and running ability because the slower they were, the hungrier the tribe would be.  Ever try to run down an antelope?  Then you get my drift, don't ya?  Also, the older guy is less likely a good candidate for a mate - girls needed to save themselves for really healthy mates who were more likely to produce healthy offspring.  That's why most young women prefer young men rather than the more experienced and often gentler older man when it comes to reproductive behaviors.  It's just plain nature, y'see.",

The most a muslim should have done is to stop reading that newspaper.. . There were lot of religious leaders that have condemned killing of innocent civillians. Attacks on civillians done by anyone is terrorism.",

Why? , . i think because for The prophet cartoons, these cartoons were a direct insult for most precious person for any muslim in the world,so how ever how the person is educated he&#92;she will understand the insult and will protest against it. . . then why this doesnt' happen for terrorism?... i think this have many reasons,. 1. the most remarakable terrorism action is 9/11 and it was against americans, and many muslims dont like americans, so they didnt care that 2000 americans were dead, then the question why they dont like americans? for this answer check this : http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=Ah3tUGeQCVPkY2mLcZSIecjsy6IX?qid=1006041322001. . 2.Many islamic leaders already objected on the terrorism actions and trying there best to stop it. . . 3.For the muslim youth (at least as i see them in my country), why protesting against terrorism which kills americans and israelians, in the time those americans and israeilans are killing muslims in afganistan, Iraq and were killing then since 50 years in palastine and STILL killing them there till now, so we do they protest ?, by their way of thinking, it's just justice! . . That doesn't mean that terrorism is accepted at all, just when u r attacked and killed and your land is taken and occupied dont expect that those occuped people will go and protest for the occuper rights ? that doesn't make sence right ? . . 4. For me ( I am a muslim girl) i would like very much to go and protest against terrorism , but you dont undestand that protesting and making demonestration is something very hard in here, and would lead to many bad results, it's not easy at all to go and say \"No for terrorism\" the way the police and government deals with demonestrations in here still needs great developing to be really modern.. .

        "answer": [
            "What other ppl have said is mostly an ideal 'flowery' way of solvong the problem , be it educating, humanity, love etc. The problem i believe lies in the basic human instinct of making oneself SECURE and Happy . And when their are millions of us on the earth with the same urges,and instincts, ones happiness is surely gonna encroach upon another guys due to competition at every level say, housing, jobs and even hot chiks, which in simple words brings happiness to a human.. So racism is one way ppl try to secure their space and happiness by joining large  groups and safegurding each others interests. Other problems also arise due to the same cause, like terrorism and  and corruption but racism has hit the world for long and bad because there are large numbers of ppl (and their votes) involved,  and larger the group , the stronger they are. Forces of democracy, u could say. .    Not that only democracies have racism. Middle east where the rulers are biased and represent one community also face the brunt of racist/communal riots. But I haven't heard of racist fights in China which is a populous country with minimal democracy. I found the link below about the type of racism in China..

        "question": "why are american women so materialistic?",
        "answer": [
            "Materialism isn't just about financial comfort, it's about status.  Not all American women are materialistic though, as others have mentioned.  Lots of women dig power and confidence, and men who are motivated with a lot of drive.  They're more exciting. Rich dudes tend to be pretty confident, though whether or not they're exciting is another thing.  You gotta consider as well what it would be like to get pregnant and then have a man leave you once you have a child.  Now you need major bucks for diapers and formula AND you gotta work too.  . On the flipside, you could ask why most guys like hot women (I'm a guy and I only date hot women), cause once you've been with some, you don't feel attracted to a woman whose sorta cute or just average.  Lots of women complain about this, but lots of us guys gotta have a hottie, so us men slave at the office, and more and more women better hit the gym to compete with their fitter and healthier counterparts.. To me it's about degree.  If she's really materialistic then forget it, but if she's only a little or somewhat materialistic, then that's tolerable, and that's just life. . You'll often notice a correlation as well between a woman's self-image and degree of materialism.  Generally the more materialistic she is, the lower her is self-image is once you REALLY get to know her.  . Consider her upbringing as well. What kind of life did she have growing up.  Was she a super princess who always got everything?  This is a complex issue, but the bottom line is don't let it get you down... there are lots of ways to a good lady's heart.  The gold diggers aren't worth anybody's time.",
            "Not all american women are materialistic.  Some women believe they must have an abundance of luxury yes, but there are those who find the abundance in what they already have achieved rather than what else they can have.

Also, the way the soldiers treat the iraqis puts doubt in ones mind as that certainly isnt the way to liberate the people. The real reason is believed to be oil. the price of oil was increasing and america needed more control over oil recources. It is also believed that G.Bush needed to show that he was indeed takin measures against terrorism as the media was reporting how he failed the country on numerous occasions such as 9/11 and this would help raise his status again. But for all we know he might just not like iraqis. Hope this helps.",

As for those names you wrote at the bottom, they are basically unknown in the US but this is how we would pronounce them:. DALL-zeel. MEN-zeez. la-MONT (much more common among Black people). .

My darling girl has really had to deal with a lot of bizarre English since she came over here.

            "You must have read the other answers by now, I hope you find this one to be more informative.  God will forgive anything you can repent sincerely of.  Repentance is truly being sorry and never wanting to commit more sin, especially the same ones over and over.  . . That said, if you have Christ as your savior, you eventually walk with Him to the point of not wanting to sin against anyone you love, anyone...especially Christ.  Furthermore, if you do get to heaven and stand in the presence of the Lord, you must account for every idle word, and deed.  Do you want to sit and give excuses to the One who saved you and gave you eternity with Him in a place that will be beyond your greatest dreams?. . You do not have to be bad to go to hell, just lost and deceived.  In my opinion, also scared or lazy.  It is scary at first to give up the life you know in this fallen world and it seems easier to just go on in ignorance of the gift He offers.  Neither option is better than just giving up what this world offers, because in the end you have pain and disappointment either way, and with Jesus, you are never alone.. . So ask yourself, why do I want to get away with...whatever it is you want to experience.  Is it worth an eternity of damnation, because you will only have your reward here on earth if you choose the wrong path.  Seriously, what do you have to lose in the end?"

            "To say we close our eyes when we sleep is to say we have something to do with it but we don't. Our eyes close automatically. Whether our eyes are open or shut is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. The condition is involuntary. Although while awake we can close our eyes voluntarily as soon as we stop thinking about it they openand we do not have to think about keeping them open. As soon as we lose consciousness they automatically close. Closed eyes help us sleep and also they are less likely to dry out. . There are people who often sleep with their eyes partially open.",

I may remind you that most of occidental laws are based on roman law and make some research and compare roman law with roman church.  I am sure you will ask for fogiveness when you needed it. don't worry you will not have any problem  if you are truly sorry.

        "answer": [
            "Wittgenstein is not the first philosopher you should read. there are others whose contribution is more basic to the subject as well as easier to understand. These include Descartes, Locke, Hume and Mill. Amongst Wittgenstein's contemporaries they include Russell and Quine. In addition, Ryle's book \"The Concept of Mind\", published just before Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\", is also highly influential as an argument aginst \"The ghost in the machine\", and is much more readable.. . Having placed Wittgenstein in context, his work is essential reading if you are to understand twentieth century philosophy, particuarly the philosophy of mind and of language, both of which have been crucial for twentieth century advances in thought. This applies both to Wittgenstein's earlier work, the \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" with its picture theory of truth and the \"Philosophical Investigations\" which overturned Wittgenstein's earlier ideas with the notion of the language game.. . Wittgenstein is difficult to read, or rather to understand. You will need to read one, and probably several, of the many introductions to his works before approaching his main texts, and it will greatly help to go to lectures and/or tutorials on Wittgenstein. One reason is that Wittgenstein believed that philosophical works should stand on their own merit, and as a consequence the influence of previous philosophical thought on his work, for instance Augustine, Frege and Russell, is not always obvious.. . A further issue is that Wittgenstein's own ideas gave rise to a belief that the philosopher's personal life is irrelevant to his (or her) thought This belief has been followed by many more recent philosophers, but in Wittgenstein's own case it is very problematic. Wittgenstein's own life was remarkable in many ways, and deeply tortured. It may have led to inluences on his work that neither Wittgenstein nor his interpreters fully appreciate or wish to admit if they do. For this reason I would strongly suggest that you read the standard biography, \"Wittgenstein\" by Ray Monk, before or alongside your philsophical reading on Wittgenstein.",
            "Take a look on wikipedia at his major achievements and make up your own mind whether he interests you.. . He's in the monty python philosophers song. \"Heidegger, heidegger was a boozy begger. Witgenstein was a beery swine who was just as sloshed as schlagel....\"."

Here is what Abraham Lincolon said on the subject:  . . \"For too long, every ounce of forgiveness I owned was locked away, hidden from view, waiting for me to bestow its precious presence upon some worthy person. Alas, I found most people to be singularly unworthy of my valuable forgiveness, and since they never asked for any, I kept it all for myself. Now, the forgiveness that I hoarded has spouted inside my heart like a crippled seed yielding bitter fruit. . No more! At this moment, my life has taken on new hope and assurance. Of all the world’s population, I am one of the few possessors of the secret to dissipating anger and resentment. I now understand that forgiveness has value only when it is given away. By the simple act of granting forgiveness, I release the demons of the past about which I can do nothing, and I create in myself a new heart, a new beginning.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive even those who do not ask for forgiveness.. . Many are the times when I have seethed in anger at a word or deed thrown into my life by an unthinking or uncaring person. I have wasted valuable hours imagining revenge or confrontation. Now I see the truth revealed about this psychological rock inside my shoe. The rage I nurture is often one-sided, for my offender seldom gives thought to his offense!. . I will now and forevermore silently offer my forgiveness even to those who do not see that they need it. By the act of forgiving, I am no longer consumed by unproductive thoughts. I give up my bitterness. I am content in my soul and effective again with my fellowman.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive those who criticize me unjustly.. . Knowing that slavery in any form is wrong, I also know that the person who lives a life according to the opinion of others is a slave. I am not a slave. I have chosen my counsel. I know the difference between right and wrong. I know what is best for the future of my family, and neither misguided opinion nor unjust criticism will alter my course.. . Those who are critical of my goals and dreams simply do not understand the higher purpose to which I have been called. Therefore, their scorn does not affect my attitude or action. I forgive their lack of vision, and I forge ahead. I now know that criticism is part of the price paid for leaping past mediocrity.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive myself.. . For many years, my greatest enemy has been myself. Every mistake, every miscalculation, every stumble I made has been replayed again and again in my mind. Every broken promise, every day wasted, every goal not reached has compounded the disgust I feel for the lack of achievement in my life. My dismay has developed a paralyzing grip. When I disappoint myself, I respond with inaction and become more disappointed.. . I realize today that it is impossible to fight an enemy living in my head. By forgiving myself, I erase the doubts, fears, and frustration that have kept my past in the present. From this day forward, my history will cease to control my destiny. I have forgiven myself. My life has just begun.. . I will forgive even those who do not ask for forgiveness. I will forgive those who criticize me unjustly. I will forgive myself.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit.\"",

He was pure Jewish. there are white jews today but that is because they traveled from Israel to other nations (europe, hence wwII, south america, etc) He on the other hand was very jewish, straight from the line of David (who was also very Jewish) there wasnt much mix in there of non-jews other than ruth (the only non-jew) who was somewhere in there...I think David's great grandmother.. Pure jews are not blonde...although he mightve had light skin which i doubt was too light cause he walked alot in hot temperatures including that time in desert for 40days.",

Does it have a house if it's an outside dog?  It's better if the house is the right size for the dog.  Dogs also have separation anxiety.  They look to you as the leader of the pack, so to speak.  You must act as it's leader, or it's lost.  Like children, they need someone to look to for discipline, rewards, food, etc..   i could likely provide more specific remedies if I knew your particular situation.

            "Currently 13 is considered to be an unlucky number. However, I am told it used to be--and in some earth-worshipping, i.e.,      , religions still is--a lucky and magical number. Consequently there were 13 months and 13 zodiac signs (the Gemini twins had separate identities). Knowing how Christianity and other god-as-a-man-based religions were prone to say that what the      s (Earth-and-god-as-a-woman) considered good was bad. So really the number 13 is lucky, but in some places its unlucky for some odd reason, so 13 is not unlucky at all!",
            "The reason that the number 13 is unlucky (as well as Friday the 13th) is because there were 12 Apostles and Jesus was the 13th.  He was crucified on Friday - ergo the unlucky day became known as Friday the 13th."

If it is the cat peeing/pooping in your room and not the litter box, then I would suggest several items.  Is this more than once?  Are they spayed/neutered?  (If not, they should be).. . First, have him/her checked by a vet. You will want to rule out any physical problems such as a UTI or other issues. Is he neutered? (If not, that raises a different series of physical causes).. . Second, you need to remove 100% of the odor from the area he urinated. Just because you can't smell it doesn't mean they can't! Pets stores sell special cleaners such as natures miracle to help with this.. . Assuming it is physical, address that issue with your vet.. . If it is not physical, ask yourself has anything changed? . . Did you move the litter boxes? Did you change the brand of litter? Are the litter boxes still in a fairly attractive area for the cat(and well away from their food/water)? Does the cat feel safe?  (I have heard all sorts of stories about this -- people not figuring out that: leaving the boxes in the basement with no lights at all; placing a dog crate next to the cat box; putting the cat box next to the cat food, etc. are all bad ideas). . . Have you added any new people or pets to the household? Have you changed your routine a great deal. Put simply, cats hate change!. . You also might want to restrict access to that room except when you are present. That can help prevent the problem -- and would help determine the cause.. . I also like the Feliway pheromone spray if the cat seems to be marking their territory."

Don't forget to remove the gas valve and filter screen first:) . You should be able to pick it up at an automotive store.. . On another note, when storing the bike for the winter, you want to make sure you tank is FULL. This will prevent rust as it doesn't let oxygen come in contact with the steel inside.

When done and take is clean rinse with gas several times then let dry and rinse with gas again.. . This takes care of the rust and debris in the tank and if you have ever put any solid objects in the tank like my kids have you will know how hard they can be to get out. The ice melts and drains right out. Be sure that once you start with the water you do not stop until it is rinsed out with gas as this will promote the rust if you do. If at any point you fell a weak spot in the metal of the tank stop because the tank will not hold up and this could be potentially fatal."
