Although its motion is not readily apparent, the entire galaxy is rotating about the Milky Way's center. Relative to the universe, the galaxy is moving at a speed of c.370 mi per sec (c.590 km per sec) in the same direction that the constellation Leo lies relative to the earth; it is also moving at c.60 mi per sec (c.100 km per sec) relative to the center of mass of the local group of galaxies. The sun, traveling at a speed of c.150 mi per sec (c.240 km per sec) in a nearly circular orbit, takes 200–230 million years to complete one revolution.. Visual Characteristics of the Milky Way. . Among the constellations the Milky Way passes through are Carina, Crux (the Southern Cross), Sagittarius (where it is brightest), Scorpius, Aquila, Cygnus, Perseus, Cassiopeia, Auriga, and Gemini. In the direction of Cygnus is the Great Rift, a band of dark matter that lies along the Milky Way, dividing it into two forks. Another dark region is the Coalsack, in Crux. Once believed to be vast empty regions in space, these dark areas are now known to be clouds of dark matter blotting out the light behind them. Such nonluminous clouds of dust and gas, called dark nebulae, obscure many parts of the sky from sight; in the direction of the galactic center, the view is almost entirely obscured.. . Size and Shape of the Milky Way. . The Milky Way is a large galaxy comprising an estimated 200 billion stars (some estimates range as high as 400 billion) arrayed in the form of a disk, with a central elliptical bulge (some 12,000 light-years in diameter) of closely packed stars lying in the direction of Sagittarius. It is surrounded by a flat disk marked by six spiral arms—four major and two minor—which wind out from the nucleus like a giant pinwheel. Because of these arms, the Milky Way was classified as a spiral galaxy. However, increasing evidence indicates that the Milky Way probably has a bar or barlike structure of new, bright stars in its central region. This would modify its classification to a barred spiral or an intermediate type between barred and “normal” spiral. Our sun is situated in one of the smaller arms, called the Local or Orion Arm, that connect the more substantial next inner arm and the next outer arm. The sun lies roughly two thirds of the way from the center of the disk, which is some 28,000 light-years distant, and in the galactic plane. When we look in the plane of the disk we see the combined light of its stars as the Milky Way. The diameter of the disk is c.100,000 light-years; its average thickness is 10,000 light-years, increasing to 30,000 light-years at the nucleus.. . Certain features of the region near the sun suggested that our galaxy resembles the Andromeda Galaxy. In 1951 a group led by William Morgan detected evidence of spiral arms in Orion and Perseus. Another bright arm stretches from Sagittarius to Carina in the southern sky. With the development of radio astronomy, scientists have extended a nearly complete map of the spiral structure of the galaxy by tracing regions of hydrogen that dominate the spiral arms.. . Surrounding the galaxy is a large spherical halo of globular star clusters that extends to a diameter of about 130,000 light-years; this is called the stellar halo. The galaxy also has a vast outer spherical region called the corona, or dark halo, which is as much as 600,000 light years in diameter and, in addition to dark matter which accounts for most of the Milky Way's mass, includes some distant globular clusters, the two nearby galaxies called the Magellanic clouds, and four smaller galaxies.. . Stellar Populations and Galactic Evolution. . The stars, gas, and dust that make up the Milky Way can be grouped into two broad stellar populations that suggest",

            "The hair is not actually turning gray, it is simply the hair follicle that is not producing the color anymore.  Gray hair is actually colorless hair and like everything else that slows down as we age, the pigment in hair follicles does as well.",
            "Have you ever watched someone try to cover up gray hair by dyeing it? Or maybe you wonder why your granddad has a full head of silver hair when in old pictures it used to be dark brown? Getting gray, silver, or white hair is a natural part of growing older, and here's why.. . Each hair on our heads is made up of two parts:. . a shaft - the colored part we see growing out of our heads . a root - the bottom part, which keeps the hair anchored under the scalp. The root of every strand of hair is surrounded by a tube of tissue under the skin that is called the hair follicle (say: fah-lih-kul). Each hair follicle contains a certain number of pigment cells. These pigment cells continuously produce a chemical called melanin (say: meh-luh-nin) that gives the growing shaft of hair its color of brown, blonde, red, and anything in between. . . Melanin is the same stuff that makes our skin's color fair or darker. It also helps determine whether a person will burn or tan in the sun. The dark or light color of someone's hair depends on how much melanin each hair contains.. . As we get older, the pigment cells in our hair follicles gradually die. When there are fewer pigment cells in a hair follicle, that strand of hair will no longer contain as much melanin and will become a more transparent color - like gray, silver, or white - as it grows. As people continue to get older, fewer pigment cells will be around to produce melanin. Eventually, the hair will look completely gray. . . People can get gray hair at any age. Some people go gray at a young age - as early as when they are in high school or college - whereas others may be in their 30s or 40s before they see that first gray hair. How early we get gray hair is determined by our genes. This means that most of us will start having gray hairs around the same age that our parents or grandparents first did. . . Gray hair is more noticeable in people with darker hair because it stands out, but people with naturally lighter hair are just as likely to go gray. From the time a person notices a few gray hairs, it may take more than 10 years for all of that person's hair to turn gray. . . Some people think that a big shock or trauma can turn a person's hair white or gray overnight, but scientists don't really believe that this happens. Just in case, try not to freak out your parents too much. You don't want to be blamed for any of their gray hairs"

Atomic nuclei are composed of two types of particles, protons and neutrons, which are collectively known as nucleons. A proton is simply the nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom, the lightest atom, and has a unit positive charge. A neutron is an uncharged particle of about the same mass as the proton. The number of protons in a given nucleus is the atomic number of that nucleus and determines which chemical element the nucleus will constitute when surrounded by electrons.. . The total number of protons and neutrons together in a nucleus is the atomic mass number of the nucleus. Two nuclei may have the same atomic number but different mass numbers, thus constituting different forms, or isotopes, of the same element. The mass number of a given isotope is the nearest whole number to the atomic weight of that isotope and is approximately equal to the atomic weight (in the case of carbon-12, exactly equal).. . .

        "question": "how were the witches tested in the salem witch trials?",
        "answer": [
            "Besides the methods mentioned above, an accused witch was literally bought to trial before the court. The court decided if they were guilty or not based on testimony given.. If a person could not say the Lord's prayer perfectly, they were thought to be possesed by the devil, and thus, a witch.",
            "The events which led to the Witch Trials actually occurred in what is now the town of Danvers, then a parish of Salem Town, known as Salem Village. Launching the hysteria was the bizarre, seemingly inexplicable behavior of two young girls; the daughter, Betty, and the niece, Abigail Williams, of the Salem Village minister, Reverend Samuel Parris.  .      . The Witch House  In February, 1692, three accused women were examined by Magistrates Jonathan Corwin and John Hathorne. Corwin's home, known as the Witch House, still stands at the corner of North and Essex Streets in Salem, providing guided tours and tales of the first witchcraft trials. John Hathorne, an ancestor of author Nathaniel Hawthorne, is buried in the Charter Street Old Burying Point.   .    By the time the hysteria had spent itself, 24 people had died. Nineteen were hanged on Gallows Hill in Salem Town, but some died in prison. Giles Corey at first pleaded not guilty to charges of witchcraft, but subsequently refused to stand trial. This refusal meant he could not be convicted legally. However, his examiners chose to subject him to interrogation by the placing of stone weights on his body. He survived this brutal torture for two days before dying. . It is remarkable 552 original documents pertaining to the witchcraft trials have been preserved and are still stored by the Peabody Essex Museum. . . Eerie memorabilia associated with the trials, such as the \"Witch Pins\" used in the examination of witches and a small bottle supposed to contain the finger bones of the victim George Jacobs can be found there as well. .     .   *These short paragraphs are intended only as an introduction to a complex subject about which much has been written.  .   A more provoking commemoration, the Salem Witch Trials Tercentenary Memorial dedicated in 1992, can be found adjacent to the Charter Street Old . Burying Point.  .  .   . --------------------------------------------------------------------------------.  . Witches Today  . Of course, Salem has become known as Witch City! The Salem Witch Museum , the Witch Dungeon Museum and The Witch History Museum take you back in history to 1692, yet, present-day popularization of the witchcraft hysteria doesn't reveal anything about the large number of modern Witches living in Salem today. . The Salem Witch Village, where people can learn the facts about Witchcraft, is highly recommended by many members of the Salem Craft Community. The goal is to promote religious tolerance and participation in a positive society that encourages growth and acceptance of all its people. .  . . The Witchcraft Trials in Salem: A Commentary . by Douglas Linder. . . O Christian Martyr Who for Truth could die . When all about thee Owned the hideous lie! . The world, redeemed from superstition's sway, . Is breathing freer for thy sake today. . --Words written by John Greenleaf Whittier and inscribed on a monument marking the grave of Rebecca Nurse, one of the condemned \"witches\" of Salem. . .     From June through September of 1692, nineteen men and women, all having been convicted of witchcraft, were carted to Gallows Hill, a barren slope near Salem Village, for hanging. Another man of over eighty years was pressed to death under heavy stones for refusing to submit to a trial on witchcraft charges. Hundreds of others faced accusations of witchcraft. Dozens languished in jail for months without trials.  Then, almost as soon as it had begun, the hysteria that swept through Puritan Massachusetts ended. .     Why did this travesty of justice occur? Why did it occur in Salem? Nothing about this tragedy was inevitable. Only an unfortunate combination of an ongoing frontier war, economic conditions, congregational strife, teenage boredom, and personal jealousies can account for the spiraling accusations, trials, and executions that occurred in the spring and summer of 1692. . .      In 1688, John Putnam, one of the most influential elders"

RADAR (RAdio Detecting And Ranging) uses very short bursts of radio signals (usually in the upper MHZ to the low GHZ range) to detect objects (aricraft, ships, precpitation, etc). When the burst hits an object, a small portion of the energy is reflected back to the antenna. If you measure the time it takes to receive the reflected energy, you can calculate how far away the object is. Now a days it all computerized, so you dont have to, the computer does. . .

Most of the time they can tell you if they could be put with a 350 or a 400.  That may give you the answer.  In my experience, modifications or new parts have to be bought to put a 400 into a vehicle with a factory 305 or 350 (the tranny/converter fit too tight on a 400).  They are all 8 cylinders and I think that they are all machined from the same basic form.  Maybe someone could help me out here, but doesn't a 400 require a larger oil pan than a 350?  I believe the 305/350s are small blocks and the 400s are bigblocks.  Since it came from a dirt track car, it could be a 350 bored over to a 400.  I'm assuming you don't have it torn down or you could look at the crankshaft.  Something you can also look at the 8th number in your VIN (for the engine size originally in the truck - if it's a GM) and then see if it looks like your engine mounts were modified or the exhaust manifolds look like they fit tight - not an exact answer, but it should give you an idea.",

            "4_0": "According to the bee keepers who posted to the site below:. . The drone bees, whose sole role in life is to inseminate a queen bee, have served their purpose and, with cold weather coming on, their lazy ways and demands for food can no longer be tolerated. They are either driven out to die in the cold or, if they refuse to leave, are killed and carried out by their sisters who are rightly called worker bees.. .  . . Like us, the bees must prepare for the winter ahead and Tandy and I talked mainly about bees and beekeeping in winter.. .  . . Most of the upper hive bodies called \"supers\" where honey is stored were last removed in September, each hive usually giving up between 75 and 100 pounds of honey over the year. (The record for a single hive, Tandy told me, is over 300 pounds but professional beekeeper Sue Hubbell reports that in bad summers her Missouri hives can produce as little as 20 pounds.). .  . . Tandy leaves a several supers for the bees to feed on through the cold weather when outside food sources are not available. Some beekeepers, he told me, take more honey but leave sugar water for the bees to feed on.. .  . . That last honey the bees gathered mostly from our common fall flowers, goldenrods and asters. I read that an early cold snap can crystallize aster nectar and injure the bees carrying it. Tandy's bees feed mostly on goldenrod and he prefers that.. .  . . To defend themselves against cold, the remaining bees gather into a sphere-like area inside the hive. Each bee contributes a small amount of heat to the cluster maintaining the center at 68 degrees. It is colder at the periphery of the sphere but these outside bees elbow their way toward the center after a short time. Thus the mass of about 50,000 bees is constantly rotating. At the same time, as the honey is consumed in one part of the hive the cluster slowly shifts to another.. .  . . Remarkably, in late January the bees will become more active, in this way heating up the interior of their cluster to 86 degrees, enough to allow their queen to begin laying eggs.. .  . . Bees are fastidious housekeepers, but this can cause a problem in winter. They will not defecate in the hive and need occasional warm periods like our January thaws to allow them to make what are called cleansing flights. This can often be a problem for anyone hanging clothes on an outside line. Their sheets would quickly become yellow-spotted. In severe and unrelenting winters the constipated bees become ill and many die.. .  . . Moisture is another problem. Bees produce propolis, a bee glue with which they seal up cracks in the hive wall, but some ventilation must be provided to allow water vapor to escape. When there are deep snows, the heat of the hive will melt the surrounding snow cover but the beekeeper must carefully remove any residue so that water won't enter the hive. Other than that, Tandy said, there is little the beekeeper needs to do in winter.. .  . . Winter is also the best time, he told me, to become a beekeeper. Searching out catalogs, purchasing and preparing hive-building materials and ordering bees for spring should be done now. The Western New York Honey Producers is an active support group in the region but they do not offer instruction. Tandy generously offered to provide initial guidance to interested beginners himself. His Akron phone number is 716-542-9182.. .  . . Since most wild beehives have been lost to disease, we can thank amateur and professional beekeepers for the bees that not only produce honey but also pollinate our plants. We'll see those bees again when the red maples bud and the dandelions bloom early next spring.-- Gerry Rising",

        "answer": [
            "Thats because people are spending instead. The reason they are spending is because of increased borrowing thanks to still existant low interest rates. Interest rates are low because the money supply is relatively large thanks to the FED's sales of treasury bonds, a monetary policy which allows us to stimulate economic growth by expanding our money supply and therefore offer low interest rates. Our large money supply has also contributed to the devaluation of the dollar (along with some inflation and an ever increasing trade defecit), encouraging foreign countries (especially China) to buy more treasury bonds from the FED, therefore floating us the money to further expand our money supply and keep interest rates down, even though the more bonds we sell, the greater out government debt (to China) since bonds are pretty much governmnet IOUs. . . In the long run, remember that the money people save is the same money banks use to lend out to borrowers. Without bond sales by the FED, the lack of savings in banks will shrink the pool of availiable money (excess reserves) banks have for loans. They will respond by raising interest rates. Investors will borrow less at higher interest rates. As costs increase, firms will cut production, people will be laid-off, and spending will once again decline with savings experiencing a rebound. Recession will return and be gone when increased savings has helped expand the pool of loanable funds, interest rates lower, and investment is attractive again. This is the buisiness cycle, an inevitable by-product of capitalism.. . By the way, I'm an AP Macroeconomics teacher. :)",
            "The savings rate is negative because people are living beyond their means. Back in 1933 when the US Government developed Social Security, it was announced as a supplimental income and citizens were asked to save at least 10% (15% reconmended) from each paycheck into some form of investment to be used for retirement. People didn't listen, but we had a Baby Boom which caused a population growth. Social Security was designed as a pyramid sceme to have the younger taxpayers support the retired ones. Not that many people lived to the age of 65 or 70 to collect Social Security back in 1933. In the 1960's the liberals forced birth control and abortion on the culture and society of the USA, which slowed down the population birth and stopped the Baby Boom. This caused a problem because that Social Security pyramid was now upside down due to a decrease in population births thanks to birth control and abortion, and thanks to medical advances people were living to the age of 65, 70, 80, 90, ect. This put a drain on the Social Security system and the US economy. It got worse in the 1980's 1990's as Baby Boomers begain to retire. The economy might crash in 2015 when the last of the Baby Boomers start to retire and the Social Security system will be paying out twice as much as it bring in with taxes.. . The negative savings has to do with Baby Boomers retiring and cashing in their stocks, IRAs, 401Ks, and other investments. It was starting to be felt in 1999 when the Dotcom companies and technology companies fell. The economy took a tumble in 1999 due to these factors. I myself lost $50,000 in savings in 1999 due to those economic factors making my IRA worth less money. 2000 started to get worse, and in 2001 we had a war going on, 2003 another war, deficit spending stimulated the economy a bit, but the savings rate took a hit.. . Materialism is partly to blame, people keep buying things to keep up with their neighbors. A failing health insurance system is to blame as well, as most bankrupcies are caused by high medical bills. Liberalism is partly to blame for forcing birth control and abortion on the population, causing a reverse Baby Boom, meaning fewer births. High gas prices are partly to blame, as it eats into people's savings. There are other factors as well.. . The economy is great, because it is a consumer driven economy. The more things people buy, the stronger the economy grows. The problem is that hardly anyone is saving, and most people are borrowing money to live on. Most people live paycheck to paycheck and cannot even follow a budget. Good for banks, good for businesses, good for the government that taxes them all, but bad for the consumer who now owes more money than before. Only people are selling stocks, instead of buying them, which is driving down income for most businesses as their stocks lower in value and they cannot raise capital. There are two ways a business can turn a profit, cut expenses or increase revenues. Since everyone is spending beyond their means, increasing revenue is not possible. So they stick to cutting expneses, like wage cuts or downsizing, in order to turn a profit for shareholders. If managers cannot turn a profit for shareholders, the shareholders will vote in new managers."

First off, all will agree that the audio in a commercial is generally very loud. 2ndly, when a show \"fades to black\" to go to commercial, both the video and the audio portion are faded down to zero.  So, when the commercial comes on, it sounds like it's much louder than the show you were watching. What you are hearing is the loudness difference between the quiet part of the show fading to black, and the commercial coming on \"balls to the wall\".  Additionally, when the show has a very loud scene going on, like a chase scene, it's no quieter than the commercials. The commercials just \"seem\" louder because of the way human ears work.

            "Bloody Mary: The Unauthorized Biography. Controversy and intrigue are just two of the ingredients that go into this classic cocktail. Al Martinez spills the story..  .  . RELATED LINK:A Better Bloody.  To sip a Bloody Mary in New York's St. Regis Hotel is to be in the presence of a greater power. Not God, but Fernand \"Pete\" Petiot, who, it is said, invented what was to become America's favorite morning-after drink, the hangover remedy, the compelling and infamous hair of the dog. . . I sat in the very room, the King Cole Bar, where Pete and the Bloody were introduced to America in the 1930s. While not quite a cathedral, it is nonetheless a lounge of exquisite secular taste, enclosed in the comfort of dark wood and dominated by a large mural of the merry old soul himself, surrounded by an entourage from the lyrical world of the nursery rhyme.. . According to drinking lore, encapsulated in Christopher O'Hara's book The Bloody Mary (with William Nash photographs of such glory that you want to drink the pages), the Bloody was invented by bartender Petiot at Harry's New York Bar in Paris. The basic recipe consisted of vodka, tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, and cayenne pepper.. . Legend has it that he named it after Queen Mary Tudor, or Bloody Mary, the Catholic daughter of Henry VIII, who, during her five-year reign, managed to kill off an impressive number of Protestants. Even by the standards of 16th-century England, the slaughter of some 300 \"heretics\" seemed excessive.. . Others ascribe the name to a bar in Chicago called \"Bucket of Blood,\" and still others believe it was based on the complaints of a London visitor to Harry's Bar who kept drinking Petiot's tomato juice libation while going on about his wife, Mary. Using one of England's most popular adjectives, the man declared his wife was a bloody nag and bloody impossible, among other bloody evils. So Petiot, in a fit of whimsy, named his drink the Bloody Mary. You can believe any bloody story you like, but most seem to prefer the influence of the bloody Queen.. . However, for those who cant toward a good scare, there is the urban legend of a woman named Mary who was injured in an accident that tore her face so badly she bled to death. Her spirit is said to roam about, and if you stand before a mirror and say Bloody Mary three times, her mangled visage will appear. If so, dash for the door or she'll rip you up, too. You'll surely need a drink after that.. . To continue the more likely tale, John Jacob Astor fell in love with the Bloody at Harry's, and brought Petiot and his drink to The St. Regis, which the Astors owned. Word of its existence spread like a dirty joke, and in no time at all, the Bloody became a standard morning-after libation and, later, one of the drinks favored at a modern invention called brunch, leading it to become at one time the third most popular cocktail in the country. Fearful that the name might offend, however, the Astors renamed it the Red Snapper. But that, forgive me, lacked the snap of the original and ended up in the barrel of bad ideas, where the mango Martini and the Pet Rock reside.. . There are as many ways to prepare a Bloody Mary as there are to cook potatoes. King Cole bartender Gavin Fitzgibbon, himself somewhat of a cocktail historian, assured me that his Bloody was concocted with the same recipe created by Petiot. \"We do not,\" he proclaimed in the grand style of a purist, \"attempt to popularize it.\" Unlike those days in Paris, however, the drink at The St. Regis sells for $17, and while it is a very nice drink, it is not worth three times the price of the taxi that took me to the hotel in the first place.. .

The tonsils have a whitish coating in at least one third of the cases. The spleen, (sometimes referred to as the body's biggest lymph node), is an organ found in the left upper abdomen underneath the ribcage which becomes enlarged or swollen in about 50% of patients with \"mono.\" An enlarged liver may also occur. About 5% of patients have a splotchy red rash over the body, which has a similar appearance to the rash of measles. . . How is \"mono\" diagnosed? . . The diagnosis of \"mono\" is suspected by the doctor based on the above symptoms and signs. \"Mono\" is confirmed by blood tests while testing to exclude other possible causes of the symptoms. Early in the course of the illness, blood tests show an increase in a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte). Some of these increased lymphocytes are unusual or \"atypical\" lymphocytes, which suggest \"mono.\" More specific testing, such as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests, can confirm the diagnosis of \"mono.\" These tests rely on the body's immune system to make measurable antibodies against the EBV. Unfortunately, the antibodies may not become detectable until the second or third weeks of the illness. A blood chemistry test can reveal abnormalities in liver function. Testing to exclude the possibility of a strep throat is also considered for some patients."

        "answer": [
            "The purpose of laboratory testing of seed germination is to assess seed quality or viability and to predict performance of the seed and seedling in the field. Seed processed for sale must be tested by a qualified laboratory under the Association of Official Seed Analysts Rules for testing seeds. Several different kinds of testing are available depending on the type of seed to be tested, the conditions of the test, and the potential uses of the seed. The most common tests are the warm germination test, cold germination test, accelerated aging test, and the tetrazolium test. Each test is designed to evaluate various qualities of the seed. Factors that can affect the performance of seed in germination tests include; diseased seed, old seed, mechanically damaged seed, seed stored under high moisture, and excessive heating of seed during storage or drying. In most cases a seed treatment will improve germination of seed only if the poor quality is due to seed-borne disease. . . The most common test is a warm germination test because it is required by seed laws to appear on the label. The percentage of germinating seed in a warm germination test must be printed on the label of the seed if it is to be sold as seed. Germination is defined as: \"the emergence and development from the seed embryo of those essential structures which are indicative of the ability to produce a normal plant under favorable conditions.\" The warm germination test reflects the stand producing potential of a seed lot under ideal planting conditions. Usually 400 seed from each seed lot are placed under moist conditions on blotters, rolled towels, or sand and maintained at 77 degrees F for about seven days. At the end of this period the seedlings are categorized as normal, abnormal, or diseased, and dead or hard seeds. The percentage germination is calculated from the number of normal seedlings from the total number of seeds evaluated. . . The cold germination test is designed to measure the ability of seeds to germinate under high soil-moisture content and low soil temperature. This vigor test simulates early season adverse field conditions and usually represents the lowest germination that would be expected from a seed lot planted under such conditions. Actual field germination would normally fall between the cold test result and that of the warm germination test. Seeds are planted in a sand-soil mix at high moisture content and maintained at 50 degrees F for seven days. The test is then placed at 77 degrees F for four days. The percentage of healthy seedlings that emerge at least one inch above the soil is reported. . . The accelerated aging test estimates the carryover potential of a seed lot in warehouse storage. The seeds are exposed to high temperatures and high relative humidity for short periods of time that cause seed deterioration. Seed are suspended over water in a chamber for 72 hours (wheat and soybeans) or 96 hours (corn) then tested in a standard warm germination test. This test only would be used on seed whose longevity was in question. . . The tetrazolium test is a \"quick test\" for seed lot viability. It is useful when an approximate germination percentage is needed immediately. Seeds are soaked overnight in water then treated with tetrazolium to give an indication of viable, abnormal, and dead seeds in the seed lot. This test will not detect seed-borne disease, thus is limited in its ability to estimate seed quality. This test is highly reliable for determining viable seed of corn, wheat, oats, barley, and other grasses. . . If growers wish to use bin-run seed and has not had a germination test conducted by a competent laboratory, they can get an approximate germination test using the following procedure in their own home. . .

We did an experiment in college where we put seeds on a rotating disk to throw of their gravity detection.  The seeds roots were not able to orientate themselves.. .

NO bread, pasta, croutons on salad, rice or sweets (at all...NO CHEATING!!!!.This is not a calarie counting diet..okay...just Carb counting!   I had no more than 20 carbs a day.  Some days I had 15.  I did this for a month and lost 30 pounds.  Went from a size 12 to a size 7/8.   I believe you can do this.  The GREAT thing was I did not have to excercise at all...I did not excercise at all.   This is not easy, but it does work if you do it right.  The Atkins diet....look online at the site to find out more or buy the book.  Just go to yahoo and type in atkins diet.

With this stat you are going to gain around 7 pounds at the end of year.. . This weight is so slow that you cannot measure it weekly. But in fur years you are going to gain around 28 pounds.. . So how can you expect this weight to go in few days? You are going to lose the way you have gained it. So it will take time to lose weight. So you have to start losing weight systematically.

Make sure your flame is low, you don't want to char the outside of them before the inside is done.  And watch for flareups, if you cook until the fat runs out, it will flare up and give an off flavor to the burger.  Lastly, you could purchase a food thermometer...140 degrees for medium, and 165 for well done.  Good luck, and email me with any questions!. . OH YEAH!  One more thing...you don't have to make a 'test' burger, you could always just crack it open a little to see the inside, and then serve crack side down on the bun!",

I'm not exactly sure on why they are contagious, but it's probably due to a psychological response.  Kind of like when you're sitting at lunch and one person takes a drink.

Personally, I think it is a much better environment for them, but you need to understand that they may not immediately take to your surroundings the way you would like.  Firstly, there is the cage training/litter training thing.  Rabbits are naturally neat creatures and therefore are fairly easy to train.  The key is patience.  Also, if your rabbit has not been spayed, you might want to have this done as it will make potty training easier.  My suggestion is to line a cat litter pan with newspaper, then cover that in hay.  This will give the bunny a reason to go into the pan in the first place, as well as something to dig around in to cover up their \"business\" when they are done.  . . Another important thing to consider is chewing.  Because a rabbit's teeth are constantly growing, they chew to keep them ground down.  Make sure your bun has plenty of safe chew toys to play with.  Mine  love cardboard boxes, telephone books, wooden bird toys, and baby teething keys.  One thing to remember is that wires and the like are often found at floor level, making them a convenient place for a bun to chew.  Not only is this bad for your home electronics, it can give your rabbit a nasty shock too!  Your local electronics store should have some good, sturdy cable wraps to tuck away such temptations.  . . You should also think about restricting your rabbit's access to carpeted areas of the house.  Often rabbits will attempt to graze on carpet, which of course, destroys the rug in question, and can also make the rabbit sick.  Some rabbits never have this problem, and others are seemingly impossible to break from it, so it's all about trying things out with your bun, and seeing what works for you both.  . . If you have any specific questions about bunny training, or keeping house rabbits, feel free to e-mail me (hmelton@sbcglobal.net) anytime.  I currently have 3 sweet little buns living in my house, and have kept indoor rabbits for years.  . . Hope this helps -- and check out the site listed below for some good reading on the subject!",

The decoration of Easter eggs to further enhance their value became an art form centuries ago and continues today. Dyes made from vegetables, edible flowers, fruits, coffee, tea, leaves, bark, and roots were used to tint the eggs. Lovely designs were created by wrapping the eggs in ferns before tinting. The art progressed, with western Europeans becoming expert at creating intricate patterns in vibrant colors on the small eggs. . . Here are explanations of some of the many types of decorated eggs: . . • Etched: Traced back to Macedonia, this process involves dying the egg, applying a layer of wax in a design, then bleaching off the color leaving only the wax-covered areas with color.. . • Krashanky: The Ukrainian word means color, and these eggs are dyed a solid, brilliant color, often red to symbolize the blood shed by Christ on the cross.. . • Fabergé: Probably some of the most famous and most expensive Easter eggs known are those created by Russian jeweler Peter Carl Fabergé in the 1800's. The eggs were made of gold, silver and jewels and most opened up to reveal exquisite tiny figures of people, animals, plants or buildings. A total of 57 eggs were made. These are obviously museum artifacts of high value.. . • Jeweled: Designs are created by gluing any manner of sequins, beads, flowers, etc., onto blown eggs.. . • Cut-Out or Carved: Blown eggs are used also for these creations where a portion of the shell is cut away. The exterior is decorated, and the inside filled with a little scene to be viewed through the cut-out section. These can be exquisitely elaborate."

With the current (as of 4/06) technology and market offerings, any mp3 player with double digit memory capacity (e.g., 20GB, 30GB, etc.) is hard drive based and any mp3 with memory in MBs or single digit memory (e.g., 128MB, 512MB, 1GB, 2GB, etc.) is flash based.  What's the difference here?  Hard drives have moving parts and don't deal well with lots of sudden physical movements.  Flash memory is in the form of chips with no moving parts.  So, if you want a mp3 player for the gym or jogging use a flash based one; hard drive mp3 players are not advised.  It is a trade-off between resilience (flash memory) and capacity (hard drives)."

Anxiety Disorders are serious medical illnesses that affect approximately 19 million American adults. Unlike the relatively mild, brief anxiety caused by a stressful event such as a speech before a large audience or the first day on the job, anxiety disorders are chronic, relentless, and can grow progressively worse if not treated. Fortunately, most people with Anxiety Disorders can be helped to recover.. . There are several categories of Anxiety Disorders including:. . * Generalized Anxiety Disorder characterized by excessive, unrealistic worry that lasts over 6 months. Symptoms may include trembling, insomnia, dizziness and irritability;. * Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder characterized by persistent, recurring thoughts that exaggerate anxiety or fears;. * Panic Disorder characterized by severe distress that may make an individual feel like they are having a health problem or are losing control;. * Post Traumatic Stress Disorder can be followed by a traumatic event such as a sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, or a disaster. Symptoms may include sleep deprivation, irritability or poor concentration;. * Social Anxiety Disorder is characterized by extreme anxiety about being judged by others or behaving in a way that might cause embarrassment. Symptoms may include heart palpitations, faintness and blushing.. . How to Get Help for Anxiety Disorders:. . Effective treatments for Anxiety Disorders including medications and psycho-social treatment are available and if someone has symptoms, a visit to the family physician is usually the best place to start.

Parents do not KNOW that the child will do the same thing again and they likely HOPE the child will not.  Any form of \"restriction\" is a form of punishment whereby certain privileges or even rights are taken away.  This is a model of how criminals are treated in our (U.S.) society.  Depending on the infraction, more or less privileges are taken away.  It is obviously not the best deterrent but would you rather that parents torture their children into submission every time they commit an infraction?",

            "Siberian huskies are tough dogs but they are very smart and can learn quickly.  . . For basic obedience, I recommend you look at your local library for \"Siberian Huskies for Dummies\" or \"the Dog Whisperer\", both are very helpful books.  If your local library does not have them, you can ask them (usually available on their website) for an interlibrary loan.  . . A good website for husky-specific training tips was mentioned above: http://www.husky-petlove.com/husky_alpha_training.html.  I tried these ideas with my dog and had great results.  . . Some tips:. Huskies cannot be trained to be off a leash.  Period.  . . If you NEVER feed your dog from the table, (s)he will NEVER beg.  . . If you limit food (most Huskies only need 1 cup of dry food twice per day, according to our vet), then you can use food as a great motivator, even if it is just a small morsel of bread or a kibble.  To train your dog to kiss with his nose, you can say \"kiss\" then physically move his nose to contact your cheek, then say \"good boy\" and give a food reward.  After about 5 of these (s)he will be trained.  . . If basic obedience is a problem, make sure you are giving your husky enough exercise.  It makes a huge difference.  . . Good luck.",

Unless a person is open to it w/ no judgement, and they are sincere in learning, not in disproving, God will open your spirit up to Him and HIs Word, and all will make sense.. Only those who seek it sincerely, and will find God, and only those who He reveals Himself to through His Word, will truly get it.. . Read 1 Cor 2:11-16:. \"For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgment: . \"For who has known the mind of the Lord .  that he may instruct him?\" But we have the mind of Christ.\". . I would reccomend if you really want to know answers and learn about Him either way, get yourself into a Bible study. . http://wec.upci.org/churches. . that will teach you the Word of God from beginning to end and you can make an educated decision on it for yourself....

Your body will change shape with the development of breasts and the enhancement of your hips. You're body will mature and you will begin menstruation, the most beautiful part of puberty... I mean, I know, periods suck, but it means that you are a woman who can bring life into this world. Puberty is hard, you will have mood swings and maybe depression. Your weight will flucuate and your hormones will go crazy, but it really is an important and beautiful time in your life, so take care of yourself and enjoy being female.",
            "3_9": "puberty , period during which the onset of sexual maturity occurs. It usually takes place between the ages of 10 and 15 in both sexes but sometimes occurs as early as 7 or 8 years of age in females. The pituitary gland secretes hormones that stimulate enlargement and development of the sex organs, which thus become capable of reproduction. The appearance of secondary sex characteristics also occurs during puberty. In females the reproductive cycle of ovulation and menstruation begins, pubic hair appears, and development of the breasts and other body contours takes place. Physical changes in males include production and discharge of semen, appearance of facial and body hair, and deepening of the voice. Skin difficulties, such as acne, may affect both sexes. Puberty, a transition period coinciding with adolescence, involves both physiological and psychological adjustments. It is often marked by emotional stress arising as the adolescent relinquishes childhood behavior patterns and adopts those of an adult.. . AND BOYS DO NOT HAVE PUBERTY BECAUSE ONLY GIRLS DOES",

Having huge breasts ain't all it's cracked up to be. Trust me when you get older you will understand that more and more."

Despite this perfect execution, it will not ammount to much change  in Iraq.  40 people were killed and 120 people wounded yesterday despite the actions against Zaraqawi.  . . The reason is this will ammount to no change is that the plan is wrong.  The Bush Administration and millitary brass have put our soldiers into a situation where they cannot succeed.  They can't figure out who is helping and who is the enemy.  This situation could have easily been predicted at the outset of the war with the ethnic make-up of the area and the lack of infrastructure outside of the iron fist of Sadam.  For reasons that are unclear, no one prepared for this kind of war after Sadam was toppled.  I predict we will eventually have Iran 2 for Iraq.  . .

Certainly, there are a lot of examples of the British media taking time out to explore Islamic culture and to try and portray a more accurate view of lifestyle and culture.. . In the sources below, I post a link to a radio documentary broadcast on BBC last weekend which I believe provides an in-depth and objective view on the topic. It's two hours and has some fluffy stuff before the programme, but well worth listening to.. . However, the media will report news. A group of Arabs sitting in a coffee shop discussing philosophy isn't news and won't get reported.. .  Agroup of muslims taking to the streets of London demanding that a cartoonist be executed for drawing some pictures is news. It also runs against the culture of fairness and free speech that is the core of our democracy - so it is certainly going to portray Islam in a bad light.. . The Western culture has a very different way of undertaking protest. It tends to be non-violent and based around debate. Yet whenever we see Islamic protests they seem to involve threats or actual violence, flag burning and intimidation.. . In the case of the London protests, these were not born out of fruistration at not being able to make a point - these were the first instincts of protest.. . You see, Islam and the Arabs have a real image problem in the West. It isn't just a problem with our media not understanding you - it is just as much about you and your media not attempting to understand us.",

Whilst jews genraly dont go on a avengence campain, the downfall of spain in a mere 10 years left an impression on mideval europe about what the Jews are when they are in their country, and what their country is when the jews are not there. The Jewish Talmud makes its students more sharper then those who are not.. . So chrisitans arent interesting in starting another jewish persocution age, and Islam reared up its own head againt christanity. Jews living in arab lands where called dimis, they where servants of the states with little to no rights, when all the Jews left the arab countries, the arabs where very scared on what would be. So when they attack, they think they are attacking both christian and the jews who whent to the other side of the fence with them.",

I use mine when the cork breaks off too deep for the corkscrew to reach.. . Cut a straight length of the wire. Bend one end at right angles, then again. You want a \"J\" with two right angles instead of a curve, and a very long body. The bent part should be about half the diameter of the cork.. . Slide the bent part down between the cork and the bottle neck, then turn it so the end is in the center of the cork. Wrap the other end of the wire around the pliers, to give you a handle. Pull.. . I made a wooden handle for mine, but I use it once or twice a year and keep it in the kitchen drawer with the corkscrew.. . You can get a Swiss Army knife with a corkscrew and 6 other handy blades for less than $20. You are worth it. Spring for it.",

At absolute Zero (0 K), the partciles have stopped completely.  If all the particples have stopped, there is not way that it is going to move up/down/side to side since if it did, it would have some temperature ad thus not be at absolute zero.",

But if we consider the whole universe, though there is a decrease in temperature at one particular point, there will be increase in temperature at other points. So, you will always see a positive change in entropy. According to third law of thermodynamics, change in entropy would be zero only at absolute temperature. And we can not attain absolute zero temperature as there would be temperature corresponding to zero point energy associated with the atoms. That is the reason why we can attain hundredth of a Kelvin but not absolute zero. In order for the change in entropy to be negative, you have to go below absolute zero which is not possible. At absolute zero, atoms won't move which means that everything is ordered and the change in entropy is zero."

He wanted a place where both children and adults could learn and have fun together.  Disney believed in being a child at heart.  Children search, discover, and are not embarrased to admit they have learned.  Disneyland was created as place of education, hope, and love to all people.  Embracing the child within is healthy and is something that should be explored by every individual, everyday.  I'm not naive enough to think that elements in Walt Disney's original plan for Disneyland have not been changed for business purposes, and there is the slowly spreading belief that Disney is for children, when Walt Disney firmly believed that any business geared directly toward children would not be successful.  So, no Disneyland is for everyone.  It's for discovering that sometimes fantasy is more real than reality.  . . One time a man was at Disneyland and sat on a bench next to another, older man who, at the time, was difficult to recognize.  The younger man mentioned how Disneyland kept you from reality, and the older man promptely answered that this park was reality, and it was everything outside of it, that was fantasy.  That older man was Walt Disney.. . So go enjoy Disneyland.  Learn the beautiful history behind It's a Small World, so you may enjoy it.  Understand it's appearance at the World's Fair.  Know what a step that World's Fair was in technology and the understanding of other cultures.  Learn and explore.  It's a small world after all, with a lot to learn in it.

P.S when head is at machine shop get your valves & seats cut properly as you will be grinding valves & seats for days and the job won't be as good.. . Hope this was of help.",

(“Nicholaos” can be found as “Nicholas”, “Nikos”, “Nick”, and “Claus”). And “Nikitas” (medieval/modern Greek) which means “winner”. . (“Nikitas” is only a male name but it was used (mainly by the Slavs) as “Nikita” for both male and females. That’s why you have a female character named “Nikita”.

For example, even if Jesus came back, there would still be some who wouldn't believe he was who he claimed to be!  . . After all, he was crucified his first visit!. . You think that may be why he hasn't come back? :-). . Moreover, there is disagreement even among Christian sects (Catholics, Baptists, Presbyterians, and so on), about how your life should be lived.  So even among his followers, there is, and most likely always will be, disagreements.. . And we haven't even mentioned the Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and others.. . Moreover, I imagine that God wants it that way!  I believe he practices \"free speech\", and he doesn't bar anyone's beliefs in how to live - until, and this is the key here, until (1) they claim theirs is the only true religion, and (2)they  harm others.. . So to achieve the goals of your question, we must work to allow anyone to worship any god they choose, and respect that decision, unless the two rules above are violated.. . I believe that's what god wants! . . But you pose a good question, and I hope you find a way to help achieve the premise!",

And the Geezers felt the same way towards those who preceeded them, and on back through history...even the great philosophers of antiquity pondered the generational differences.  We're talking guys who lived, thought and wrote thousands of years ago, yo!. . It's primarily biological.  Human animals are programmed to be ferociously competitive simply to survive, as we once had to do right after we climbed down outa the trees and began walking upright.  Oaky, yeah, we had to be tough before then, too...the \"out of the trees\" is just an imperfect analogy.  Anyway, it's built in.  Younger hunters/warriors had to push the older guys out of the way whenever the older guys began to slow down in their reaction times and running ability because the slower they were, the hungrier the tribe would be.  Ever try to run down an antelope?  Then you get my drift, don't ya?  Also, the older guy is less likely a good candidate for a mate - girls needed to save themselves for really healthy mates who were more likely to produce healthy offspring.  That's why most young women prefer young men rather than the more experienced and often gentler older man when it comes to reproductive behaviors.  It's just plain nature, y'see."

The key is to use as little water as possible, so that you aren't simply spreading it around.  Let it dry completely between cleanings... you should repeat 3 times.

            "Public speaking is an art that requires practice. Ah's, eh's, and um's are all common filler words that Americans use when they are unsure of their next set of words. For a prepared speech I would simply practice the speech several times before actually delivering it. However, if you are part of a situation that involves impromptu (no notes; press conference. e.g.) or extemporaneous speaking( limited preparation and some notes; class report . e.g.) breaking the \"ah\" habit will be much more difficult. First, instead of using a filler word, just pause for a moment. If you are at the end of a sentence this will appear very natural and I guarantee the pause will seem much longer to you than it will to the audience. The pause will benefit the audience allowing them to absorb what you have said, and also benefit you, eliminating the ah and providing time to reorganize thoughts.. . If you listen to Jazz musicians speak about improvisation they will always mention the importance of silence in improvisation to providing actually musical quality. Imagine if The drums and horns never stopped playing. It would be a cacophony no one would enjoy. The same holds true for public addresses. A speaker that never stops is a speaker no one is going to truly listen to or at the very least enjoy.. . Of course, you should practice avoiding filler words in all of your conversations. Habits we develop in everyday speech will also pop their heads up in public addresses. Therefor, even if you are just talking to a friend about some trivial matter, try to avoid filler words.  Don't be afraid to ask you friends to point out when you use any. . . As a final piece of advice, if nothing else seems to work to get rid of the ah's, I would suggest \"practice sessions.\" Practice delivering a speech in front of an audience (humans, not cats or babies) and have the audience throw things at you or squirt you when you use a filler word. Physical teaching is even effective in speech. . . Best of luck.",

As you may know Henry Kissinger, US Secretary of State under Presidents Nixon & Ford says \"Oil is much too important a commodity to be left in the hands of the Arabs.---\" . Fact is Oil cant be produced in an unstable country because it is flamable itself and need lots of pipeline to transfer so there must be stable countries in unstable atmosphere.. Middle east has been unstable for many years, USSR and UK has been in territory before WWI and has been replaced by US after that. Israel and Arabs have problems since WWII, Iranians and Arabs have problems even before Islam.... About being poor, apart from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahran, Iran, Iraq, Indonesia, Turkey, Lebonan... there are some poor Islamic countries like Yaman, Afghanestan..... I don't think Islam has been the reason that they are poor, they are mostly countries without resources and good leaders, some of them have been in war since many years ago like Afghanestan.. You can't generalize it, there are many rich Islamic countries and there are poor Islamic countries, you can't say every christian country is rich or every Islamic country is poor.. Proper question is why Islamic countries are not advanced in technology. You can't compare Islamic countries with China, as you know most of resources are in Small countries and they rather buy western cars every year instead of making a automobile factory, you must take it easy on them, you can't force Emarat Arabs to do so, you better know how they are, they even don't explore their oil, western companies do that for them, they don't have an army, western troops protect them, what do you expect of these people? to spend money on science? Do you think its Islam fault?. This is not a problem with Islam, this is a problem with  Muslims, you know that most of Islamic scientist weren't from Saudi Arabia.. You know that science has been emphasized in Islam, there is a Hadith from Mohammad that says \"Learn Sience from cradle to grave\". Like always you have neglected Iran, I have told you, you don't know anything about Iran, there is an Iranian passenger car(Maybe not comparable with BMW but It's not that bad, it can satisfy euro3 standards http://www.ikco.com) and TVs, there are some Iranian TV producers and there are good universities in Iran, they export lots of students each year and we explore our oil ourselves.",

And when their are millions of us on the earth with the same urges,and instincts, ones happiness is surely gonna encroach upon another guys due to competition at every level say, housing, jobs and even hot chiks, which in simple words brings happiness to a human.. So racism is one way ppl try to secure their space and happiness by joining large  groups and safegurding each others interests. Other problems also arise due to the same cause, like terrorism and  and corruption but racism has hit the world for long and bad because there are large numbers of ppl (and their votes) involved,  and larger the group , the stronger they are. Forces of democracy, u could say. .    Not that only democracies have racism. Middle east where the rulers are biased and represent one community also face the brunt of racist/communal riots. But I haven't heard of racist fights in China which is a populous country with minimal democracy. I found the link below about the type of racism in China..

Personally speaking, honey, my Conscience holds me accountable for every mean word I say to others.  My Conscience holds me accountable for each bird I flip to other drivers.  My Conscience screams at me if I shirk from my responsibilities.  My Consience is based on the ethics that my parents taught me, that the law of the land requires I adhere to to be a good citizen, plus ethics I have learned from various different religions and philosophies of the world.. . Being agnostic OR atheist does not mean we run from our responsibilities.  Most of us DO live highly ethical lives as according to what we stand for (treating others compassionately, helping others when needed, taking responsibility when required).  We hold ourselves accountable. . . Personally speaking for myself, I am agnostic simply because Religion has yet to prove that 'god' exists AND science has yet to disprove 'god'.

One who is skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism. . One who is doubtful or noncommittal about something. . . adj. . Relating to or being an agnostic. .

Theists believe there is a god, atheists are people who aren't theists, they lack that belief. There is nothing in between, you either believe there is a god, or you don't.. . Agnostics are people who have no knowledge of a god. I imagine this usually goes along with atheism, people have no knowledge of a god and thus lack belief in a god, and so they are agnostic atheists (or atheistic agnostics if you prefer it that way around). I have met some people who say they have no knowledge that a god exists, but believe anyway (because they want it to be true maybe, I don't know). These people are agnostic theists.. . Personally I'm an agnostic atheist. I have never experienced or perceived a god in any way and thus lack any knowledge of a god, and since I can't believe in something I have no knowledge of I lack belief in a god too.",

Keep up your nutrition and fluid intake; please wash your hands so you dont get any secondary infections or give this to someone else. Please be careful not to expose elderly to this as it can be fatal. You may want to get another opinion.  The doctor might want to check for Shingles on your ear; characterized by little blisters on the skin and pain along the nerve that it has infected.  Praying for your recovery.  God Bless.",

We were lucky enough to get over it with the usual course of antibiotics. It is SOOO contagious so maybe that is why you keep getting reinfected. You have to clean everything that you come in contact with; wash your hands obsessively. Keep going to your Dr.; because as I'm sure you know, this MRSA can in fact possibly kill you. Good Luck, I really feel for you.",

He just made it look as though he bashed the troops. It really doesn't matter if you don't finish school that you end up in the Military(look at Kerry, who people say got lower grades than Bush and look where he ended up. MILITARY!, he must think that he's living proof) it doesn't matter what he TRIED to say. The fact is that he said it and that one of the most respected politicians(even though he's a republican, democrats respect this guy) John McCain said that Kerry should apologize. Yeah, he tried to make a joke, and now he should have just apologized and not done damage control at this point, bashing everybody who misquoted him(even though, you can clearly see it on video) So, since you won't hear a sincere apology out of him, I'll do it for him. I'm sorry. I won't say another word about it. Especially when I'm trying to win points with my party for a 2008 election by helping them get control of congress back",

His grades were worse than GW.. He had to write his own recommendation for a medal.. He voted against Iraq before he voted For Iraq.. He couldn't get elected to the Presidency.. . Sounds pretty stupid of him to go to all this trouble of opening his mouth and sticking his foot in it.. . By the way. the percentage of  people in the Military who have high school diplomas or higher education is considerably higher than in the general population, so it isn't true that only uneducated people end up in the military. . People are stupid who believe that because they think themselves better than military folk. How Elitist to think so.. Most Democrats are the elitists. They think that Blacks and Hispanics are dumb and cannot get ahead without Government help.. Of course this isn't true, Many Blacks and Hispanics are Middle Class (as is my best friend) and worked hard to get educated and or start their own businesses, but democrats think that those are anomalies."

Lots of women dig power and confidence, and men who are motivated with a lot of drive.  They're more exciting. Rich dudes tend to be pretty confident, though whether or not they're exciting is another thing.  You gotta consider as well what it would be like to get pregnant and then have a man leave you once you have a child.  Now you need major bucks for diapers and formula AND you gotta work too.  . On the flipside, you could ask why most guys like hot women (I'm a guy and I only date hot women), cause once you've been with some, you don't feel attracted to a woman whose sorta cute or just average.  Lots of women complain about this, but lots of us guys gotta have a hottie, so us men slave at the office, and more and more women better hit the gym to compete with their fitter and healthier counterparts.. To me it's about degree.  If she's really materialistic then forget it, but if she's only a little or somewhat materialistic, then that's tolerable, and that's just life. . You'll often notice a correlation as well between a woman's self-image and degree of materialism.  Generally the more materialistic she is, the lower her is self-image is once you REALLY get to know her.  . Consider her upbringing as well. What kind of life did she have growing up.  Was she a super princess who always got everything?  This is a complex issue, but the bottom line is don't let it get you down... there are lots of ways to a good lady's heart.

            "3_8": "To the first respondent.  Alright asswipe...how many hours of prime serving time are there in a day?  How many hours does it take to set up, take down, and clean the bar?  What do you make an hour?  Now divide it all out.  Believe me, bartenders and food servers are not in line to take over for Donald Trump.  Most have a hard time making ends meet.. . I think the question implies excellent service and wonders given good service, why do people tip less than 10%?. . A lot of people in the hospitality industry do the job because it fits a schedule where they can be students or moms or work a second job during the day, work in a restaurant during the night.  Restaurant servers need to \"tip out\" other employees  - busboys, bartenders - and it is not optional as well as cover those who occasion the restaurant to \"dine and dash.\". . I have worked a lot of jobs (including landscaping, factory work, dish-washing, and janitorial work) and serving tables is one of the tougher ones...just because you see the person for four minutes does not mean that they are not occupied with your interests nearly the entire time you are in the restaurant - before you showed up and after you leave.  There is a lot of risk in what your nightly income might be.  Sometimes worthwhile, sometimes not.. . For any of you who did not get the memo, here is current customary gratuity etiquette in the U.S.. . If you get awful service, talk to the manager. The manager cannot correct the situation if he doesn't know about it. Skipping the tip will not accomplish anything, and the next poor customer who gets that server will get the same service you did.. . If you are buying the meal and someone offers to get the tip, tell them they can buy next time, and you pay the whole thing. This prevents any uneasiness about them seeing the amount of the bill or worrying that they will be stingy on the tip.. . Restaurants report a percentage (around 12%) of the gross sales for food and beverage to the IRS for their staff. This means that if you have a $200 food bill and $200 wine bill, the restaurant will report 12% of $400 or $48 as income to the server. In other words, the server has to pay tax on it whether you tip it or not. If the restaurants do not report it accurately, the restaurant and the wait staff get audited by the IRS. . . Please don't get hung up on the 12%. It is just a reasonable example. I recommend tipping 10-15% on the alcohol and 15-20% on the food. 10% on the wine is perfectly acceptable. Whether to tip 10 or 15 percent would depend in large part on how helpful the server was in choosing the wine and serving it. . . Food server - 15-20% . Cocktail server - 15-20%. For free drinks in Vegas, tip $1-2 per round. . Bartender - 15-20% or $1 per drink. If at the bar before a meal, settle up with the bartender before you go to your table. . Wine steward - 10% of wine bill. . If a bar has a cover charge, you do not tip on it. . Busboys - Nothing, unless he did something extra special like cleaning up a huge mess. Then give him $1-2. . Maitre d' - Nothing, unless he gets you a special table or the restaurant is full and you had no reservation. Then give $5-10 or more. . Coat check - $1 . Restroom attendant - $1 . Separate checks - If you want separate checks, ask the server to go ahead and add 18% gratuity to each check. . Musician in lounge - $1-5 . Musician that visits table - $2-3 if you make a special request. Optional if he just stops by and plays. . Takeout - If you get good service, in other words, the waiter gets and packages the food, then tip $1-2 or up to 10%. . Drive through - Nothing. . Self-service restaurant or buffet - Nothing unless there is some service. Tip 10% if the server delivers all or part of your meal or keeps your drinks refilled. . When breakfast is included in the price of the hotel room - Estimate the value of the meal by looking at a menu. If there is no breakfast menu, consider the quality of the hotel",

The bible says the dinosaurs were created on the third day look at the verse that contains great sea creatures the Hebrew word for that is only used in one more case when Moses throws his staff down and it turns in to a serpent. So since we have two cases of the word we can imply that it covers both in a general way aka lizards. The word great in Hebrew can also mean big or huge so there you have it big lizards. As for the time gap look it also says the sun and the moon were created after the first day but is says that light and the world were created on the first day. This is obviously a mistake. The word for earth is the same world in Hebrew for land (aretz) this can be loosely translated to also mean matter so you can read from this light and then matter were created on the first day. Sounds like the big bang to me. For more info on this topic read Since of God by Dr. Gerald Schroeder. . He will give you answers to this and many other questions you might have",

Write a note to your parents and ask them to please remember that they have a child in the fifth grade.. 2.  In the note, tell them that you are disappointed that you are coming last in their lives. 3.  In the note, list the dates and times of when at least one of them should be at your classroom, and. 4.  Tell them that you would like them to be happy that you are wanting them to be interested in your life, in your school events, and in how you are growing up.. 5.  At the end, you can write, \"I miss having parents, but what I miss the most is having my parents in my life.\". . If they come back with \"I'm too busy,\" or \"I just can't because I have to work,\" or something else---then ask for the note back and take it to you teacher.

Today's foods for cats are pretty balanced and you'd be amazed at what they eat that you don't see during the day.  I'd put my money more on the item they are licking has something on it that they are after.  Be it something spilt on it, bacteria, mold, other cat juices...who knows.  If you can take a fresh piece of clean iron and they do it still...then I'd say diet.   . . Just keep in the back of your mind that cats not only hear better than us, they smell significantly better than us..which has a side effect of being able to taste better than us.

Perhaps the most common of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS), which occurs mainly in teenagers and young adults. It occurs when a person's body clock is running later than it should, resulting in sleep-onset and wakening times that are very late in relation to the daily cycle of life. It is at the extreme end of the 'night owl' syndrome: a night owl will typically choose to stay up until midnight, and sleep until 8 in the morning; a person with DSPS is unable to initiate sleep until well after 1 or 2 am, and has extreme difficulty awakening until late morning or close to noon.. . http://www.sunbox.com/Research/SCRD.asp",

No-hands stabilization is aided by \"wheel trail\", the front-wheel geometry that allows gravity to steer the front wheel in the direction the bike is tilted. In forward motion, gyroscopic effect also responds to a tilt of the bike by turning the front wheel in the direction of the tilt. This steering repositions the contact patches of the front and rear wheels such that the downforce vector (force due to gravity and centripetal reaction in a turn), projected through the center of mass, intersects the line joining them and thus produces no additional rolling torque on the bike."

        "answer": [
            "Butterfinger is the name of a candy bar made by Nestlé. It has a firm, orange-colored center similar in texture and taste to peanut brittle (without the peanuts), that is coated in milk chocolate. The filling has a peanut butter taste, hence the name. When eaten, it tends to crumble and then take on a peanut buttery consistency.. Butterfinger was invented by the Curtiss Candy Company of Chicago, Illinois in 1923. The company held a public contest to choose the name of the candy bar. The name is a slang term used to describe a clumsy person, often in sporting events to describe an athlete who can't hold onto the ball. As an early publicity stunt and marketing ploy, the company dropped Butterfinger and Baby Ruth candy bars from airplanes in cities across the United States which helped increase its popularity.. One of the slogans currently used to advertise the candy bar is \"Break out of the ordinary!\" Prior to that, Bart Simpson and other characters from The Simpsons appeared in numerous advertisements for the product from 1989 to 2001, with the slogan \"Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!\". Butterfinger was withdrawn from German shops due to consumer rejection when it was one of the first products to be labeled as containing genetically modified ingredients from corn.. After a series of mergers and acquisitions, the candy bar is now produced by Nestlé.",
            "Its the peanut butter candy in the middle of the bar, and the long and thin shape of the bar resembles fingers, or even finger sandwiches."

            "Tricky question.  The Holocaust was an awful event in human history, but the bigger event at the time was World War II, that literally involved every corner of Earth.  Jewish people or anyone do not take offense but the WAR had greater repercussions than the Holocaust itself - here's why.... Estimates are that 6 million Jews were exterminated, worked to death, murdered in Europe.  The end state was that Jews created Israel in 1948.. Now compare the number of Chinese, Russian (and Slavs of Eastern Europe), German, French, Japanese that died totaling in the hundreds of millions.. The Holocaust was spurned by a decision of the Nazis to rid Europe of Jews as quickly as possible.  This decision (arguably) didn't have a huge bearing on how the Allies would fight the war and defeat Germany and Japan (unconditional surrender from the beginning).. Comparisons - how many tribes/people did Ghengis Khan crush rolling through out of the Asian steppe?  How many north African tribes (originally from Europe) were wiped out by invading Arabs in the early Middle Ages?  How many Chinese did good 'ole Mao kill or starve to death in the 1960s?  How many Russians and Soviets died under glorious Stalin over a thirty year reign? (Both killed more people than Hitler). My point is that no matter in what conflict, humans have always reached some level of absolute barbarism and lose total value in human life (more recently the Khomer Rouge (sp?) in Cambodia, Milosevic in former-Yugoslavia, Saddam in Iraq/Iran and today, Darfur).  . Unfortunately, there aren't many positive LONG term effects to make much difference after human atrocities occured.  At least not many difference makers that have been successful.  The SHORT term goals are usually very good - criminal trials of the accused, memorials/museums to the deceased/fallen.  . Bottom Line - World War II resulted in many global changes, lessons to be learned from the Holocaust have largely been forgotten...Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, China (over decades since), sub-Saharan Africa (Rwanda, Somalia, Darfur), Yugoslavia, former-USSR, Iran/Iraq War, etc etc...human atrocities will likely continue..."

They do have something to offer and I'm going to find out what it is. . . All joking aside, we can choose to look at the bad in people or we can choose to find the good. It is all really a choice and sometimes it is very hard, but when I look back on my life and some of the people who I love today, I have to admit had I not of taken the approach I did I would of missed out on some fantastic friendships. Some of my friends really were annoying and drove me crazy, but like I said they are great once I got to know them. Too often people tend to have preconcieved notions about someone or a race and instead of finding out for themselves they just continue on with that un fortunatly they really miss out. I love people and I love to learn from them and we never know when that stranger or annoyance will change your life for the better if you let them. We live in a great world with great people it's just do you look at it that way. I give everyone the benefit of the doubt until they prove me wrong then I go my own way but I'm at peace then.  Take care and choose to look for the GOOD in people it is sooo much better.  Sorry about any typo or incorrect spelling.",

        "answer": [
            "Wittgenstein is not the first philosopher you should read. there are others whose contribution is more basic to the subject as well as easier to understand. These include Descartes, Locke, Hume and Mill. Amongst Wittgenstein's contemporaries they include Russell and Quine. In addition, Ryle's book \"The Concept of Mind\", published just before Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\", is also highly influential as an argument aginst \"The ghost in the machine\", and is much more readable.. . Having placed Wittgenstein in context, his work is essential reading if you are to understand twentieth century philosophy, particuarly the philosophy of mind and of language, both of which have been crucial for twentieth century advances in thought. This applies both to Wittgenstein's earlier work, the \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" with its picture theory of truth and the \"Philosophical Investigations\" which overturned Wittgenstein's earlier ideas with the notion of the language game.. . Wittgenstein is difficult to read, or rather to understand. You will need to read one, and probably several, of the many introductions to his works before approaching his main texts, and it will greatly help to go to lectures and/or tutorials on Wittgenstein. One reason is that Wittgenstein believed that philosophical works should stand on their own merit, and as a consequence the influence of previous philosophical thought on his work, for instance Augustine, Frege and Russell, is not always obvious.. . A further issue is that Wittgenstein's own ideas gave rise to a belief that the philosopher's personal life is irrelevant to his (or her) thought This belief has been followed by many more recent philosophers, but in Wittgenstein's own case it is very problematic. Wittgenstein's own life was remarkable in many ways, and deeply tortured. It may have led to inluences on his work that neither Wittgenstein nor his interpreters fully appreciate or wish to admit if they do. For this reason I would strongly suggest that you read the standard biography, \"Wittgenstein\" by Ray Monk, before or alongside your philsophical reading on Wittgenstein.",

If that doesn't put an end to this, you should probably consider the person as not a friend who respects you as you are, and disassociate from them. . .

If you are getting flakes of rust that sounds terminal to me, the tank is weak, may be leaking, and your gonna be plugging fuel filters all the time. I'd starting looking for a replacement tank.",
            "Actually there is a quick fix. They sell a product (name escapes  me) that is like a clear epoxy. You clean the tank really good, dump this stuff in and roll the tank around in your hand to spread it around the inside and let it dry. I have used it once and it did the trick. Don't forget to remove the gas valve and filter screen first:) . You should be able to pick it up at an automotive store.. . On another note, when storing the bike for the winter, you want to make sure you tank is FULL. This will prevent rust as it doesn't let oxygen come in contact with the steel inside. Just add some gas stabilizer and your good to go."

When done and take is clean rinse with gas several times then let dry and rinse with gas again.. . This takes care of the rust and debris in the tank and if you have ever put any solid objects in the tank like my kids have you will know how hard they can be to get out. The ice melts and drains right out. Be sure that once you start with the water you do not stop until it is rinsed out with gas as this will promote the rust if you do. If at any point you fell a weak spot in the metal of the tank stop because the tank will not hold up and this could be potentially fatal.",

            "I am not sure what you mean by using.  If it is going into it to sleep or explore, the answer is to close the door.. . If it is the cat peeing/pooping in your room and not the litter box, then I would suggest several items.  Is this more than once?  Are they spayed/neutered?  (If not, they should be).. . First, have him/her checked by a vet. You will want to rule out any physical problems such as a UTI or other issues. Is he neutered? (If not, that raises a different series of physical causes).. . Second, you need to remove 100% of the odor from the area he urinated. Just because you can't smell it doesn't mean they can't! Pets stores sell special cleaners such as natures miracle to help with this.. . Assuming it is physical, address that issue with your vet.. . If it is not physical, ask yourself has anything changed? . . Did you move the litter boxes? Did you change the brand of litter? Are the litter boxes still in a fairly attractive area for the cat(and well away from their food/water)? Does the cat feel safe?  (I have heard all sorts of stories about this -- people not figuring out that: leaving the boxes in the basement with no lights at all; placing a dog crate next to the cat box; putting the cat box next to the cat food, etc. are all bad ideas). . . Have you added any new people or pets to the household? Have you changed your routine a great deal. Put simply, cats hate change!. . You also might want to restrict access to that room except when you are present. That can help prevent the problem -- and would help determine the cause.. . I also like the Feliway pheromone spray if the cat seems to be marking their territory.",

Knowing how Christianity and other god-as-a-man-based religions were prone to say that what the      s (Earth-and-god-as-a-woman) considered good was bad.
