Getting gray, silver, or white hair is a natural part of growing older, and here's why.. . Each hair on our heads is made up of two parts:. . a shaft - the colored part we see growing out of our heads . a root - the bottom part, which keeps the hair anchored under the scalp. The root of every strand of hair is surrounded by a tube of tissue under the skin that is called the hair follicle (say: fah-lih-kul). Each hair follicle contains a certain number of pigment cells. These pigment cells continuously produce a chemical called melanin (say: meh-luh-nin) that gives the growing shaft of hair its color of brown, blonde, red, and anything in between. . . Melanin is the same stuff that makes our skin's color fair or darker. It also helps determine whether a person will burn or tan in the sun. The dark or light color of someone's hair depends on how much melanin each hair contains.. . As we get older, the pigment cells in our hair follicles gradually die. When there are fewer pigment cells in a hair follicle, that strand of hair will no longer contain as much melanin and will become a more transparent color - like gray, silver, or white - as it grows. As people continue to get older, fewer pigment cells will be around to produce melanin. Eventually, the hair will look completely gray. . . People can get gray hair at any age. Some people go gray at a young age - as early as when they are in high school or college - whereas others may be in their 30s or 40s before they see that first gray hair. How early we get gray hair is determined by our genes. This means that most of us will start having gray hairs around the same age that our parents or grandparents first did. . . Gray hair is more noticeable in people with darker hair because it stands out, but people with naturally lighter hair are just as likely to go gray. From the time a person notices a few gray hairs, it may take more than 10 years for all of that person's hair to turn gray. . .

The Witch House  In February, 1692, three accused women were examined by Magistrates Jonathan Corwin and John Hathorne. Corwin's home, known as the Witch House, still stands at the corner of North and Essex Streets in Salem, providing guided tours and tales of the first witchcraft trials. John Hathorne, an ancestor of author Nathaniel Hawthorne, is buried in the Charter Street Old Burying Point.   .    By the time the hysteria had spent itself, 24 people had died. Nineteen were hanged on Gallows Hill in Salem Town, but some died in prison. Giles Corey at first pleaded not guilty to charges of witchcraft, but subsequently refused to stand trial. This refusal meant he could not be convicted legally. However, his examiners chose to subject him to interrogation by the placing of stone weights on his body. He survived this brutal torture for two days before dying. . It is remarkable 552 original documents pertaining to the witchcraft trials have been preserved and are still stored by the Peabody Essex Museum. . .

From June through September of 1692, nineteen men and women, all having been convicted of witchcraft, were carted to Gallows Hill, a barren slope near Salem Village, for hanging. Another man of over eighty years was pressed to death under heavy stones for refusing to submit to a trial on witchcraft charges. Hundreds of others faced accusations of witchcraft. Dozens languished in jail for months without trials.  Then, almost as soon as it had begun, the hysteria that swept through Puritan Massachusetts ended. .     Why did this travesty of justice occur? Why did it occur in Salem? Nothing about this tragedy was inevitable. Only an unfortunate combination of an ongoing frontier war, economic conditions, congregational strife, teenage boredom, and personal jealousies can account for the spiraling accusations, trials, and executions that occurred in the spring and summer of 1692. . .

Usually the butler is the most senior staff member, although in the great houses of the past, the household was sometimes divided into departments with the butler in charge of the dining room (including the wine cellar) and pantry, and sometimes the entire parlour floor, and a housekeeper who was in charge of the whole house and its appearance. Housekeepers are occasionally portrayed in literature as being the most senior staff member and as even making recommendations for the hiring of the butler.. . In modern houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as Majordomo, Butler Administrator, Staff Manager, Estate Manager and Head of Household Staff are sometimes given.. . The word \"butler\" derives from the Old French \"bouteillier\", (meaning \"cup bearer\"), from \"bouteille\", (\"bottle\"). The role of the butler, for centuries, has been that of the chief steward of a household, the attendant entrusted with the care and serving of wine and other bottled beverages (which in ancient times represented a considerable portion of the household's assets.). . In Britain the butler was originally a middle ranking member of the staff of a grand household. In the 17th and 18th centuries the butler gradually became the usually senior male member of a household's staff (in the very grandest households there was sometimes a house steward senior to the butler into the 19th century). Butlers used to always be attired in a special uniform, distinct from the livery of junior servants, but today a butler is more likely to wear a business suit or business casual clothing and appear in uniform only on special occasions.. . The earliest literary mention of a butler is probably that of the man whose release from prison was predicted by Joseph in the biblical account of Joseph's interpretation of the dreams of the Pharaoh's servants.. . In London there remains only one hotel which offers a private butler service, The Lanesborough Hotel.",

            "4_14": "Fluid that accumulates in the pleural space because of trauma or disease is called pleural effusion. This condition may result from heart failure, cancer, pulmonary embolism, or inflammation. If blood is in the accumulating fluid, the condition is called \"hemothorax\"; if pus is present, it is called \"empyema\"; if air enters the space, it is called \"pneumothorax\"; and if there is chyle (milky fluid consisting of lymph and fat), it is called \"chylothorax.\" There are two types of pleural effusion, transudative and exudative. . . An imbalance between the venous-arterial pressure and the pressure within the pleural space (oncotic pressure) causes transudative effusions. Transudates contain few protein cells and little solid material content and have a clear, pale yellow color. Cardiac failure and, less commonly, liver and kidney disease cause transudative pleural effusion. . . Exudative effusions are caused by inflammation, infection, and cancer. Exudates have large amounts of protein cells, white blood cells, and immune cells that have migrated into the pleural fluid and deposited in tissues or on tissue surfaces. Exudates also are pale yellow in color but have a cloudy appearance. If pus is present because of infection (empyema), the fluid is yellow, cloudy, and has a foul odor. Pneumonia, tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism (blocked pulmonary artery), cancer, and trauma are common causes of exudative pleural effusion. . Mechanisms of Pleural Fluid Accumulation . An excessive amount of pleural fluid probably results from a combination of fluid draining into the tissues from the blood vessels and the overproduction of fluid by the mesothelial cells. Fluid accumulates in the pleural space by three mechanisms: increased drainage of fluid into the space, increased production of fluid by cells in the space, and decreased drainage of fluid from the space. . . Increased amounts of fluid drain from the circulation when there is hypertension in the venous system (creating pressure imbalance) or when there is too little protein in the blood. Ascites (fluid in the peritoneal space, or abdominal cavity) can drain through small perforations in the diaphragm. A large amount of fluid can drain directly into the pleural space this way. . . Abnormal mesothelial cells (as in asbestosis) can produce large amounts of fluid. White blood cells can accumulate in response to infection and inflammation in the pleural space (empyema). These cells produce fluid that is difficult to drain or that are in such large quantities that normal drainage through the lymphatic system simply cannot keep up. . . Malignant tumor cells can migrate (or metastasize) to the pleural space from essentially any type of tumor in the body. These cells can attach to either the visceral or parietal pleural surfaces or float freely in the pleural space and produce large amounts of fluid. . . When tumor cells block lymphatic drainage, fluid accumulates. If the blockage is located in the central lymphatic drainage system that drains chyle (milky fluid consisting of lymph and fat) to the thoracic duct, fluid rich in chyle accumulates in the pleural space",

        "answer": [
            "According to the bee keepers who posted to the site below:. . The drone bees, whose sole role in life is to inseminate a queen bee, have served their purpose and, with cold weather coming on, their lazy ways and demands for food can no longer be tolerated. They are either driven out to die in the cold or, if they refuse to leave, are killed and carried out by their sisters who are rightly called worker bees.. .  . . Like us, the bees must prepare for the winter ahead and Tandy and I talked mainly about bees and beekeeping in winter.. .  . . Most of the upper hive bodies called \"supers\" where honey is stored were last removed in September, each hive usually giving up between 75 and 100 pounds of honey over the year. (The record for a single hive, Tandy told me, is over 300 pounds but professional beekeeper Sue Hubbell reports that in bad summers her Missouri hives can produce as little as 20 pounds.). .  . . Tandy leaves a several supers for the bees to feed on through the cold weather when outside food sources are not available. Some beekeepers, he told me, take more honey but leave sugar water for the bees to feed on.. .  . . That last honey the bees gathered mostly from our common fall flowers, goldenrods and asters. I read that an early cold snap can crystallize aster nectar and injure the bees carrying it. Tandy's bees feed mostly on goldenrod and he prefers that.. .  . . To defend themselves against cold, the remaining bees gather into a sphere-like area inside the hive. Each bee contributes a small amount of heat to the cluster maintaining the center at 68 degrees. It is colder at the periphery of the sphere but these outside bees elbow their way toward the center after a short time. Thus the mass of about 50,000 bees is constantly rotating. At the same time, as the honey is consumed in one part of the hive the cluster slowly shifts to another.. .  . . Remarkably, in late January the bees will become more active, in this way heating up the interior of their cluster to 86 degrees, enough to allow their queen to begin laying eggs.. .  . . Bees are fastidious housekeepers, but this can cause a problem in winter. They will not defecate in the hive and need occasional warm periods like our January thaws to allow them to make what are called cleansing flights. This can often be a problem for anyone hanging clothes on an outside line. Their sheets would quickly become yellow-spotted. In severe and unrelenting winters the constipated bees become ill and many die.. .  . . Moisture is another problem. Bees produce propolis, a bee glue with which they seal up cracks in the hive wall, but some ventilation must be provided to allow water vapor to escape. When there are deep snows, the heat of the hive will melt the surrounding snow cover but the beekeeper must carefully remove any residue so that water won't enter the hive. Other than that, Tandy said, there is little the beekeeper needs to do in winter.. .  . . Winter is also the best time, he told me, to become a beekeeper. Searching out catalogs, purchasing and preparing hive-building materials and ordering bees for spring should be done now. The Western New York Honey Producers is an active support group in the region but they do not offer instruction. Tandy generously offered to provide initial guidance to interested beginners himself. His Akron phone number is 716-542-9182.. .  . . Since most wild beehives have been lost to disease, we can thank amateur and professional beekeepers for the bees that not only produce honey but also pollinate our plants. We'll see those bees again when the red maples bud and the dandelions bloom early next spring.-- Gerry Rising",

        "answer": [
            "There is no real correlation between two.  . . The fact is people want what they cannot afford, so they borrow to live beyond their means.  Materialism has its price, and for most, it is way too high.. . The real disaster is going to occur later when the spenders need to keep earning money into old age and will never be able to retire (if anyone is still willing to employ them).  Can you say \"lower standard of living.\"",
            "Thats because people are spending instead. The reason they are spending is because of increased borrowing thanks to still existant low interest rates. Interest rates are low because the money supply is relatively large thanks to the FED's sales of treasury bonds, a monetary policy which allows us to stimulate economic growth by expanding our money supply and therefore offer low interest rates. Our large money supply has also contributed to the devaluation of the dollar (along with some inflation and an ever increasing trade defecit), encouraging foreign countries (especially China) to buy more treasury bonds from the FED, therefore floating us the money to further expand our money supply and keep interest rates down, even though the more bonds we sell, the greater out government debt (to China) since bonds are pretty much governmnet IOUs. . . In the long run, remember that the money people save is the same money banks use to lend out to borrowers. Without bond sales by the FED, the lack of savings in banks will shrink the pool of availiable money (excess reserves) banks have for loans. They will respond by raising interest rates. Investors will borrow less at higher interest rates. As costs increase, firms will cut production, people will be laid-off, and spending will once again decline with savings experiencing a rebound. Recession will return and be gone when increased savings has helped expand the pool of loanable funds, interest rates lower, and investment is attractive again. This is the buisiness cycle, an inevitable by-product of capitalism.. . By the way, I'm an AP Macroeconomics teacher. :)"

            "4_10": "The savings rate is negative because people are living beyond their means. Back in 1933 when the US Government developed Social Security, it was announced as a supplimental income and citizens were asked to save at least 10% (15% reconmended) from each paycheck into some form of investment to be used for retirement. People didn't listen, but we had a Baby Boom which caused a population growth. Social Security was designed as a pyramid sceme to have the younger taxpayers support the retired ones. Not that many people lived to the age of 65 or 70 to collect Social Security back in 1933. In the 1960's the liberals forced birth control and abortion on the culture and society of the USA, which slowed down the population birth and stopped the Baby Boom. This caused a problem because that Social Security pyramid was now upside down due to a decrease in population births thanks to birth control and abortion, and thanks to medical advances people were living to the age of 65, 70, 80, 90, ect. This put a drain on the Social Security system and the US economy. It got worse in the 1980's 1990's as Baby Boomers begain to retire. The economy might crash in 2015 when the last of the Baby Boomers start to retire and the Social Security system will be paying out twice as much as it bring in with taxes.. . The negative savings has to do with Baby Boomers retiring and cashing in their stocks, IRAs, 401Ks, and other investments. It was starting to be felt in 1999 when the Dotcom companies and technology companies fell. The economy took a tumble in 1999 due to these factors. I myself lost $50,000 in savings in 1999 due to those economic factors making my IRA worth less money. 2000 started to get worse, and in 2001 we had a war going on, 2003 another war, deficit spending stimulated the economy a bit, but the savings rate took a hit.. . Materialism is partly to blame, people keep buying things to keep up with their neighbors. A failing health insurance system is to blame as well, as most bankrupcies are caused by high medical bills. Liberalism is partly to blame for forcing birth control and abortion on the population, causing a reverse Baby Boom, meaning fewer births. High gas prices are partly to blame, as it eats into people's savings. There are other factors as well.. . The economy is great, because it is a consumer driven economy. The more things people buy, the stronger the economy grows. The problem is that hardly anyone is saving, and most people are borrowing money to live on. Most people live paycheck to paycheck and cannot even follow a budget. Good for banks, good for businesses, good for the government that taxes them all, but bad for the consumer who now owes more money than before. Only people are selling stocks, instead of buying them, which is driving down income for most businesses as their stocks lower in value and they cannot raise capital. There are two ways a business can turn a profit, cut expenses or increase revenues. Since everyone is spending beyond their means, increasing revenue is not possible. So they stick to cutting expneses, like wage cuts or downsizing, in order to turn a profit for shareholders. If managers cannot turn a profit for shareholders, the shareholders will vote in new managers.",

First off, all will agree that the audio in a commercial is generally very loud. 2ndly, when a show \"fades to black\" to go to commercial, both the video and the audio portion are faded down to zero.  So, when the commercial comes on, it sounds like it's much louder than the show you were watching. What you are hearing is the loudness difference between the quiet part of the show fading to black, and the commercial coming on \"balls to the wall\".  Additionally, when the show has a very loud scene going on, like a chase scene, it's no quieter than the commercials. The commercials just \"seem\" louder because of the way human ears work.

            "Bloody Mary: The Unauthorized Biography. Controversy and intrigue are just two of the ingredients that go into this classic cocktail. Al Martinez spills the story..  .  . RELATED LINK:A Better Bloody.  To sip a Bloody Mary in New York's St. Regis Hotel is to be in the presence of a greater power. Not God, but Fernand \"Pete\" Petiot, who, it is said, invented what was to become America's favorite morning-after drink, the hangover remedy, the compelling and infamous hair of the dog. . . I sat in the very room, the King Cole Bar, where Pete and the Bloody were introduced to America in the 1930s. While not quite a cathedral, it is nonetheless a lounge of exquisite secular taste, enclosed in the comfort of dark wood and dominated by a large mural of the merry old soul himself, surrounded by an entourage from the lyrical world of the nursery rhyme.. . According to drinking lore, encapsulated in Christopher O'Hara's book The Bloody Mary (with William Nash photographs of such glory that you want to drink the pages), the Bloody was invented by bartender Petiot at Harry's New York Bar in Paris. The basic recipe consisted of vodka, tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, and cayenne pepper.. . Legend has it that he named it after Queen Mary Tudor, or Bloody Mary, the Catholic daughter of Henry VIII, who, during her five-year reign, managed to kill off an impressive number of Protestants. Even by the standards of 16th-century England, the slaughter of some 300 \"heretics\" seemed excessive.. . Others ascribe the name to a bar in Chicago called \"Bucket of Blood,\" and still others believe it was based on the complaints of a London visitor to Harry's Bar who kept drinking Petiot's tomato juice libation while going on about his wife, Mary. Using one of England's most popular adjectives, the man declared his wife was a bloody nag and bloody impossible, among other bloody evils. So Petiot, in a fit of whimsy, named his drink the Bloody Mary. You can believe any bloody story you like, but most seem to prefer the influence of the bloody Queen.. . However, for those who cant toward a good scare, there is the urban legend of a woman named Mary who was injured in an accident that tore her face so badly she bled to death. Her spirit is said to roam about, and if you stand before a mirror and say Bloody Mary three times, her mangled visage will appear. If so, dash for the door or she'll rip you up, too. You'll surely need a drink after that.. . To continue the more likely tale, John Jacob Astor fell in love with the Bloody at Harry's, and brought Petiot and his drink to The St. Regis, which the Astors owned. Word of its existence spread like a dirty joke, and in no time at all, the Bloody became a standard morning-after libation and, later, one of the drinks favored at a modern invention called brunch, leading it to become at one time the third most popular cocktail in the country. Fearful that the name might offend, however, the Astors renamed it the Red Snapper. But that, forgive me, lacked the snap of the original and ended up in the barrel of bad ideas, where the mango Martini and the Pet Rock reside.. . There are as many ways to prepare a Bloody Mary as there are to cook potatoes. King Cole bartender Gavin Fitzgibbon, himself somewhat of a cocktail historian, assured me that his Bloody was concocted with the same recipe created by Petiot. \"We do not,\" he proclaimed in the grand style of a purist, \"attempt to popularize it.\" Unlike those days in Paris, however, the drink at The St. Regis sells for $17, and while it is a very nice drink, it is not worth three times the price of the taxi that took me to the hotel in the first place.. . In quest of the elusive queen of Bloodies, I tasted samples in such diverse venues as a noisy singles joint called Gladstone's on an L.A. beach, Melrose Place's four-star Bastide, and the elegant Bull and",

His drink becomes popular with New Yorkers but something is missing. The hotel asks him to change the name to the Red Snapper, but it doesn't catch on and it is again called the Bloody Mary. His patrons encourage him to make the drink spicy, so he adds cayenne pepper, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, lemon, and a big dash of Tabasco® sauce. The recipe is a hit.. . March 30, 1956: George Jessel takes out an ad in Collier's that reads: “I think I invented The Bloody Mary, Red Snapper, Tomato Pickup or Morning Glory. It happened on a Night before a Day and I felt I should take some good, nourishing tomato juice, but what I really wanted was some of your good Smirnoff Vodka.

I cover the bottom of the shaker with four large dashes of salt, two dashes of black pepper, two dashes of cayenne pepper, and a layer of Worcestershire sauce; I then add a dash of lemon juice and some cracked ice, put in two ounces of vodka and two ounces of thick tomato juice, shake, strain, and pour.

Some of these increased lymphocytes are unusual or \"atypical\" lymphocytes, which suggest \"mono.\" More specific testing, such as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests, can confirm the diagnosis of \"mono.\" These tests rely on the body's immune system to make measurable antibodies against the EBV. Unfortunately, the antibodies may not become detectable until the second or third weeks of the illness. A blood chemistry test can reveal abnormalities in liver function.

The dish is the primary staple food throughout the Maghreb; in much of Algeria, eastern Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya it is simply known as ta`aam طعام, \"food\". It is popular in the Maghreb, the West African Sahel, in France, in western Sicily's Trapani province, and parts of the Middle East. It is also very popular among Jews of North African descent.. . Couscous was traditionally made from the hard part of the hard wheat Triticum durum, the part of the grain that resisted the grinding of the relatively primitive millstone. The name is also used for prepared dishes made from other grains, such as barley, millet, sorghum, rice, or maize. Couscous is traditionally served under a meat or vegetable stew.. . In the United States couscous is known as a type of pasta, probably reflecting the influence of Sicilian immigrants. However in most other countries it is treated more like a grain in its own right.

Hundreds of instantly cured hiccuper's have sent in their testimony's of deliverance! Files are available for researchers! Carefully understand both the HOW and the WHY of this method. If you don't get the WHY you might not get the HOW. Here's how to cure the hiccups:. . \"Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure\"© 1997. . (1) Pour a TALL glass of water.. . (2) Hold your breath... ***. . (3) IMPORTANT...PINCH YOUR NOSE CLOSED.. . (4) Slowly, take 10 - 20 swallows of the water...while holding your breath with your nose pinched closed.. . (5) When you can't stand it any more....you'll know by that overwhelming drowning sensation -- after a gasp, take a deep breath and relax.. . This cures the hiccups 99 percent of the time - guaranteed! It's a proven medical remedy! (A second treatment could be necessary for stubborn cases.). . *** For stubborn cases, try EXHALING COMPLETELY and then taking 10 - 20 swallows.. . NOW: HERE'S WHY IT WORKS: Hiccups are caused by an uncontrollable spasm in the diaphragm, (the \"breathing\" muscle). Often, this spasm is triggered by irritable conditions in the smooth muscles of the stomach or the esophagus. The \"Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure\" forces an increase in the carbon dioxide levels in the diaphragm itself, as well as in the stomach and esophagus. By swallowing, you are making the muscles work -- so they use up their available oxygen and replace it with carbon dioxide. By temporarily discontinuing to breath, you prohibit new oxygen from entering your body and thus create an anaerobic condition in the spasming diaphragm muscle. When the spasming diaphragm and stomach are deprived temporarily of oxygen and encounter the higher levels of carbon dioxide ... you feel that scary drowning sensation! BUT this causes the spasming muscles to relax! The hiccups go away! Essentially, you are \"tricking\" your body into thinking that it's drowning ... and it decides to use it's resources for something other than hiccuping. The rather \"scary\" drowning sensation caused by this method is NECESSARY for the method to work. If it's not just a little bit difficult ... it doesn't work.",

Make sure your flame is low, you don't want to char the outside of them before the inside is done.

Lastly, you could purchase a food thermometer...140 degrees for medium, and 165 for well done.  Good luck, and email me with any questions!. . OH YEAH!

The people there who were christians were like only a few Christians are here today.  They would not have met secretly and had the extremely high moral and oneness were it legal.  There you only became a Christian because you loved God and Jesus,  because doing so was life threatening.   Nobody became a christian to make their business more profitable or because their friends went to church.   Persecution is good for the church so encourage all those atheists.",

It is available with hobby shops where you buy the sequins.. . If you still want to hand-sew, it'll take a lot of time, you need to put the sequin on the fabric, bring the needle from the edge on the sequin through the fabric, and then again through the center to the other edge.",

I think they are called \"stud punchers\" or something like that.

            "1_4": "Today it is just  a fun tradition to color Easter Eggs  - historically:. . Intricate Easter egg designs date back centuries. The decoration of Easter eggs to further enhance their value became an art form centuries ago and continues today. Dyes made from vegetables, edible flowers, fruits, coffee, tea, leaves, bark, and roots were used to tint the eggs. Lovely designs were created by wrapping the eggs in ferns before tinting. The art progressed, with western Europeans becoming expert at creating intricate patterns in vibrant colors on the small eggs. . . Here are explanations of some of the many types of decorated eggs: . . • Etched: Traced back to Macedonia, this process involves dying the egg, applying a layer of wax in a design, then bleaching off the color leaving only the wax-covered areas with color.. . • Krashanky: The Ukrainian word means color, and these eggs are dyed a solid, brilliant color, often red to symbolize the blood shed by Christ on the cross.. . • Fabergé: Probably some of the most famous and most expensive Easter eggs known are those created by Russian jeweler Peter Carl Fabergé in the 1800's. The eggs were made of gold, silver and jewels and most opened up to reveal exquisite tiny figures of people, animals, plants or buildings. A total of 57 eggs were made. These are obviously museum artifacts of high value.. . • Jeweled: Designs are created by gluing any manner of sequins, beads, flowers, etc., onto blown eggs.. . • Cut-Out or Carved: Blown eggs are used also for these creations where a portion of the shell is cut away. The exterior is decorated, and the inside filled with a little scene to be viewed through the cut-out section. These can be exquisitely elaborate."

For example, if a smell is to be recognized and to be kept in memory, nerve impulses from the olfactory tract would travel to the limbic system of the brain; this system is made up of the hippocampus, thalamus, and the amygdala which control a person's memory. When the brain receives an impulse of something that is reoccuring over and over again, it will store it as a memory so it will be remembered. So memory is mainly a series of nerve impulses and the storing of information in the nuclei in the cells of the brain that relay information between the parts of the limbic system and the cerebral cortex so that memories can be stored and recalled."

            "There were a few things that led me to receiving Jesus as Lord and Savior. . One was that I was interested in a particular book on prophecy, so my husband suggested that to understand it better, I should read through the bible. Which I did.. . Also I heard an invitation to accept Jesus.Until then I didn't realize  my need for salvation.. . And the \"clincher\" was going to a bible study. My first one was called \"Examine the Evidence\". I learned how the bible was written by many different people, divinely inspired by God, from many different back grounds and locations and time periods. And that the bible was written over a long period of time. And despite all of  that, it is in perfect harmony from Genesis to Revelation.. . And I'm sure that having my saved sisters pray for me for many years had a lot to do with it too!!!. . Thank you for an opportunity to share. It is so cool that you came to know Yeshua the Messiah! Keep telling people about Him!. . And David - with no disrespect to \"Names are much too...\" You made the right decision and Jesus is the Messiah that the Jews have been waiting for. . here is link that may be helpful-. http://jewsforjesus.org/",
            "He became the ultimate sacrifice for our sins. He hung for 3 days on a cross so that we would have the possibility of being saved. We are naturally born into sin. Note: you don't have to teach a kid to lie, you have to teach a kid NOT to lie. It is our nature to sin as lying is a sin. So, He came down, made Himself a man and was crucified so that we might live. He rose again on the 3rd day to show us that He would come again for us. There is a reason to live a true, Holy repentant life as He is alive and He will come back for His people. Those that do not choose to believe this way will be punished the Bible says by living in eternal damnation, Hell. Those that choose life and believe will be saved. How to be saved? Acts 2:38 clearly gives a path:. 1. Repent- tell God you are sorry for your sins. 2. Be baptized in JESUS name- not the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost it must be in HIS name. 3. Receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  This is evidence that you have received Jesus Christ into your heart as you will speak with other tongues as the spirit gives utterance. . This is the best gift, LIFE, in the world!"

Some manufacturers these days are favoring the turbocharger because it is \"free energy\" since it runs off the exhaust gases where as a supercharger usually runs off the serpentine belt in effect making the engine work harder than it would without the supercharger.

Everyone experiences some anxiety even on a daily basis but people with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) experience constant anxiety which often has no apparent cause. GAD may be mild and manageable, but, for some people, it is debilitating. It can also cause and/or aggravate additional health problems, both physical and psychological.. . People with GAD often worry about the same problems everyone worries about - money, health, families, jobs, etc. The problem is, people with GAD worry excessively and constantly. People without GAD have the ability to put normal worries on hold and focus on daily activity. People with GAD are often distracted by their worries and find it difficult to think about anything else.. . Many people with GAD also feel constant anxiety with no apparent cause. They wake up feeling anxious and can never pinpoint a direct cause. The anxiety never seems to disappear throughout the day.. . \"Unfortunately, most people with GAD assume that they are just a 'nervous person' and that nothing can be done. They do not usually seek treatment unless their anxiety is complicated by depression, panic attacks or alcoholism. With appropriate treatment, however, GAD sufferers can feel less anxious and function better.\" -- Deborah Cowley, MD, in Psychopharmacology. . The cause of GAD has yet to be determined, and there is probably more than one possible cause. GAD appears to run in families, so there is probably a genetic factor. A major traumatic or stressful event may sometimes trigger GAD. Another theory is that the person with GAD has internal conflicts which have yet to be resolved. GAD may begin in childhood or later in life. Most likely, GAD has both physiological and psychological components.. . Generalized anxiety disorder is a relatively common anxiety problem, affecting 3-4% of the population, that turns daily life into a state of worry, anxiety, and fear. Excessive thinking and dwelling on the \"what ifs\" characterizes this anxiety disorder. As a result, the person feels there’s no way out of the vicious cycle of anxiety and worry, and then becomes depressed about life and the state of anxiety they find themselves in.. . Generalized anxiety usually does not cause people to avoid situations, and there isn’t an element of a \"panic attack\" involved in the prognosis, either. It’s the thinking, thinking, thinking, dwelling, dwelling, ruminating, ruminating, and inability to shut the mind off that so incapacitates the person. At other times, thoughts seem almost non-existent because the anxious feelings are so dominant. Feelings of worry, dread, lack of energy, and a loss of interest in life are common. Many times there is no \"trigger\" or \"cause\" for these feelings and the person realizes these feelings are irrational. Nevertheless, the feelings are very real. At this point, there is no \"energy\" or \"zest\" in life and no desire to want to do much.. . This emotional fear and worry can be quite strong. If a loved one is ten minutes late, the person with generalized anxiety fears the very worst -- something’s dreadfully wrong (after all, they’re ten minutes late!), there’s been an accident, the paramedics are taking the person to the hospital and his injuries are just too critical to resuscitate him.....\"Oh, my God!.....WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?\" Feelings of fear and anxiety rush in from these thoughts, and the vicious cycle of anxiety and depression runs wild.. .

            "I was told by a Creole Chef to first rub the chicken with your sesonings, let sit 15 min, then coat with flour. If you mix the seasonings in with the flour you lose a lot of taste when frying it.. . Try using complete pancake mix instead of flour it will come out a lot crispier. Fry in generous amounts of bacon grease or lard. Fry on Medium heat or else it will burn. Only turn chicken once about 15 to 20 min on each side. If you cover it with a lid the coating will get mushy.. . If you want to cut down on time pressure cook the chicken pieces for about 10 minutes then coat and fry.. Happy Eating and Good Luck!!!!!",
            "Unless the chicken is already fried, you can't make an authetic parmesan.  Frying chicken that's already fully cooked, unless perhaps it's dark meat, will dry it out and even though you put sauce on it to bake, it will still be dry inside.. . If, however, your fried chicken is dark meat (and hopefully boneless), you can put it cold into your baking pan and add cheese and sauce and bake it.. . I would recommend though that you preheat your oven first and make sure your sauce and cheese are all at least room temperature (preheating the sauce in a pan or the microwave would be better) so that the parmesan will not have to bake too long to prevent overcooking the chicken."

Drop your chicken in and cook until a nice golden brown, it should float to the top when it's done.  Oh yeah for my brine I use a combination of buttermilk, cayenne, garlic powder, and of course salt.  You still want to add a litt salt and pepper to your flour you coat your chicken in though.

Through the ages, the region today known as Afghanistan has been invaded by a host of peoples, including the Aryans, Medes, Persians, Greeks, Mauryans, Kushans, Sassanians, Arabs, Turks, British, and Soviets, but rarely have these groups managed to exert complete control over the region.. . Even when US was not physically present, the bullets and weapons were present and shell casings which said \"Made in USA\". . I was shocked when I read it in black & white too.. . I like to think that the US is just doing the right thing too.  I realize that countries administrations act in their country's perceived best interest, which may or may not be perceived as doing the right thing.  During the cold war it was most likely the right thing.  Years later it was like frankenstiens monster.. It had to be cleaned up.  A great evil may have been removed for the greater good of all and for the US.  In 40 years when the new administrations which we just placed in power have become old they may be the monsters.  US may have to go clean up again.. .  If we do not learn from history we are doomed to repeat."

Islamic Extremists are threatening to overthrow the government there. . . This is a new type of war. A war that can't be fought by guns and bombs and invasions. This is a war about peoples well being. Why have the Taliban made such strong strides in Afghanistan? Because they're bringing stability to the region. They bring the rule of law. . . If you look at the statistics for the places where extremism is on the rise, you can see that those places are very insular and have high rates of unemployment. These people have nothing better to do and have families to support. A lot of it isn't about idealogy. It's simple economics. And THAT is where we need to fight this war.. .

They can't figure out who is helping and who is the enemy.  This situation could have easily been predicted at the outset of the war with the ethnic make-up of the area and the lack of infrastructure outside of the iron fist of Sadam.

This whole WMD thing is a complex issue, and someone who points out that some of these things were old, aren't defending Sadaam, they are merely pointing out that the WMD argument for going to war isn't as strong as Bush would have us believe.  . This using of the words liberal and conservative as if they are evil epitaphs is not only offensive, but it gets in the way of actual discussions of issues that Are complex and do Not have easy answers.  Debate is the way to find these answers, and to generalize someone in such a way and attack them is juvenile.  Think of the junior high cafeteria, two girls in an argument, one makes a valid point, the other says, \"well you're ugly, so there!\"  and suddenly the whole argument is overshadowed by the personal insult.  The argument isn't solved and both people get hurt.  One is embarrassed and the other is seen as a bitch.  . that is exactly what is happening in this liberal/conservative war.. if you want people to see things the way you do, present a coherent argument, and just maybe you'll change someone's mind.",

Saddam was a bad guy, to most of his own people. But Bush lied to America about him being an imminent threat to America.. . Saddam killed thousands of his own people, but all of the mass graves right-wing idiots point to are from the periods when Saddam was fighting a virtual civil war. We don't say \"Lincoln is evil, he killed hundreds of thousands of Americans\", now do we? Bush Sr. promised we'd help overthrow Saddam. The people rose up, Bush did nothing, and Saddam quashed the insurgency. Does that make Saddam a good guy? No. But you at least need to have some f'n context.. . There are lots of bad guys in the world. I'm glad Saddam is out of power. But if Americans had been told before the war, \"We're going to spend $300 billion to remove a bad guy who's not an eminent threat, and in the process, create (not stop, but CREATE) an entire generation of Iraqi terrorists, and fuel hatred of America throughout the Middle East and the world\", no one in their right mind would have supported that course of action.",

            "Living in the UK, I am lucky that that a lot of our media is prepared to take a broader view on topics. Certainly, there are a lot of examples of the British media taking time out to explore Islamic culture and to try and portray a more accurate view of lifestyle and culture.. . In the sources below, I post a link to a radio documentary broadcast on BBC last weekend which I believe provides an in-depth and objective view on the topic. It's two hours and has some fluffy stuff before the programme, but well worth listening to.. . However, the media will report news. A group of Arabs sitting in a coffee shop discussing philosophy isn't news and won't get reported.. .  Agroup of muslims taking to the streets of London demanding that a cartoonist be executed for drawing some pictures is news. It also runs against the culture of fairness and free speech that is the core of our democracy - so it is certainly going to portray Islam in a bad light.. . The Western culture has a very different way of undertaking protest. It tends to be non-violent and based around debate. Yet whenever we see Islamic protests they seem to involve threats or actual violence, flag burning and intimidation.. . In the case of the London protests, these were not born out of fruistration at not being able to make a point - these were the first instincts of protest.. . You see, Islam and the Arabs have a real image problem in the West. It isn't just a problem with our media not understanding you - it is just as much about you and your media not attempting to understand us.",

Will you please stop listening to your media and start reading the history and search for the truth on your own ... . reading a few books and a few articles won't take much of your time and will make you understand the cultures that you hate so much depending on your media ... . i just received an email 2 days ago containing this link. http://nobravery.cf.huffingtonpost.com/. Do you know how bad i felt .. or how much i hated Americans and that was just me .. so what do you think the people who actually went through all this feel ? .. and then you wonder why they are terrorists .. they are not terrorists they defend themselves, their families and their kids .. and I'm talking about what's happening in Iraq and Palestine only ... .

Absolute zero has very specific thermodynamic properties - it is the temperature where atoms have the minimum molecular vibration, which defines heat.  It's too complicated to describe here - suggest you check the reference.. . Anyway, looking at temperatures from absolute zero, all temperatures are positive.  Also, every element (and compound) has its own thermodynamic characteristics, including melting point, boiling point, and freezing point.

Remember, what makes the news is generally an isolated case, but it has been generalized to sound like common practice. At the same time, there are many different educational systems and criteria that it is hard to make comparisons. For example, as a general rule, most US universities will not consider a candidate for a Master's program if the Bachelor's was completed in less than 4 years. Countries that follow the British educational style will have spent a period of \"pre-university\" that can take up to 2 years before taking the final exams for the chosen papers. Then, completion of a Bachelor's degree takes only 3 years. To compare with the American system, we have the general education subjects before specialization tends to occur. In effect, bith systems are doing the same thing, it's a hang up about the time factor or classification of an area with which most are not familiar.. . Another idea to help keep in mind, for professional types of degrees and qualifications, each country has specific ideas as to what should be in the curriculum. For example, medical schools also empasize patient care and communication as part and parcel. Other countries medical degrees take less time as they empasize more on pathology and diagnosis. . . One more thing to remember, in the US we don't have a national standard. The US universities are independent and may not even accept credits from another US university. Many universities DO offer bridging programs where should you not meet the tradtitional requirements for a master's degree, you can apply your experience as well as take a few subjects you lack to re-evaluate your situation. Thos means you won't have to repeat everything - just fill in the gaps in your education that do not meet the standards of a particular university.",

Before I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. . . So how does your body burn fat?. . It is a two steps process and in order to lose body fat you need to:. . 1.Release the fat from the fat cells and only then. 2.You can burn the fat. . How does your body release the fat from the cells?. . Before you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.. . 1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.. 2.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods. 3.Eat lean proteins with each meal.. 4.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.. 5.Drink plenty of water. . . How does your body burn the fat? . . If you started exercising and then reached a plateau, you have probably burned more muscle tissue than fat with your workout. This is the worst thing that could happen.. . Let me explain. . . Less Muscle = slower metabolism = Weight loss plateau. Then you end up in the yo-yo dieting bandwagon.. . How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.. . You need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. . Doing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime . soon. Here is what you need to do:. . 1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate. 2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...). . Your muscle tissue is your best friend when it comes to burn body fat. You need to preserve muscle tissues in order to keep losing weight. Most people go on a starvation diet combined a lot of cardio to lose weight. At first it may seems like this is working because they are losing scale weight. . . Now think about, scale weight does not tell you if weight loss is from fat, water or muscle tissue. Scale weight by itself is not a good indicator of success.. .

By that, I mean eating so that fat WILL be released from the fat cells. Then and only then they exercise the body to burn the fat. The important idea to take from this is:. . \"The fat can ONLY be burned after it is released from the fat cells\".. . If you know anybody that has been exercising like a maniac and they don't seem to go anywhere, now you know why.. . The reverse is also true, do you know somebody that is eating properly but they are not including any resistance training combined with moderate cardio. Now you know why their body still looks the same.. . All you need to do is to combine a nutrition program, along with some MODERATE cardio program and maintain muscle mass with resistance training.

From the article, here are some tips:. . 1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer. . . 2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for newly opened businesses, buildings or facilities. Then introduce yourself to the landlords ­ your potential clients ­ and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract. For effective techniques on cold calling, read \"Tips to Successful Cold Calling\"  http://www.powerhomebiz.com/blog/2006/05/tips-to-successful-cold-calling.html. . 3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the facility (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.). . 4. Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the janitorial business. Aside from newly opened buildings, get a list of companies that are downsizing or laying off cleaning staffs.. . 5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a janitorial service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other building owners or entrepreneurs in your area.. . 6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area. . . 7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.. . For detailed information I suggest you read the following books:. . - Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services . - The Janitorial Contractors Bible . - Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business . - Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor . - Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business"

The practice is done by an older woman without any specific tool, they just pull and cut.. d) Did you know that in other muslim countries they adopted the practice of sewing the vaginal lips always for the same reason, and that many of those women leave their country and have to undergo painful surgical interventions after that thraumatic experience?. g) did you know muslim immigrants still kill their daughters or sisters when they don't marry the men their parents tell them to marry. (see Germany, Turkey, Paksitan and several other places or simply check AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL). Did you know they burn their women to punish them or that they take them in the squares of their towns and kill them by lapidation with the participation of the whole citizenship?. h) Did you know in Saudi Arabia there is one of the highest rates of paedophilia?. i) Did you know muslims have one of the highest rates of homosexuality?. h) Did you know the highest number of rapists in Europe is made up of Muslims, which is even sadder if you consider their are still a minority in many countries?.

The other reason has nothing to do with school.  Homework is getting you used to the real world after you leave school.. We always have bills to pay, taxes and negotiations in writing with people in our work place and in buying a home, etc.. . It's like doing your chores that your parents made you do.  To get you used to it.. . Believe me, when you get out on your own, you'll have more homework than ever.  They're preparing you for the shock.. . You'll never escape it.",

Learning about history, language, arts, abstract mathmatics, etc, makes people more intellegent, more decisive, and more succeful in life.  When you learn about something, you may not use it in real life, but it will certainly open your eyes to something new, therefore making you more aware of the world you live in giving you a greater ability to make judgements in your own life and career because you have a heighten sense of awarness.. . Someone who has gone to only ninth grade as opposed to someone who has gotten their associates degree have vastly different views of the world.  The person with more education is more aware and can make judgement about life in general with a more aware state of mind then the person without it.. . That is why education institutions teach things that we don't use everyday.  We really do use those things, just not practically."

When dismantling short motor make sure each big end cap is kept on the same connecting rod.Also make sure each piston/con rod assembly goes back in the same bore.. The bores of your engine will need to be honed to allow rings to bed in, if not done correctly result will be high oil consumption.. when reassembling check big end bolts do not need to be replaced.BOLT FAILURE IS CATASTROPHIC!!!.

Cook:35 Min (cooking time) Preparation. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, cottage cheese, milk, lemon zest and vanilla. Make a well in the dry ingredients; add wet ingredients and stir until just combined. . Once the batter is smooth fold in the blueberries. . Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat or an electric pancake griddle to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Moisten a crumpled paper towel with vegetable oil and use it to lightly oil the skillet or griddle. Spoon on about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake and cook until bottoms are golden and small bubbles start to form on top, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is browned, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Lightly oil pan between batches. (Adjust heat as necessary for even browning.) Serve hot. . . its ´realy nice!",
            "Acquire a box of Bisquick at your local grocery and there will be instructions on the back of the box. Follow these instructions. I like to substitute Buttermilk for normal sweet milk simply because I find it makes the pancakes fluffier for some reason and they taste so much better. Don't mix your batter too thick you want it to run when you put it on the griddle. Allow enough batter to run outwards to make approximately 6-8 in flat pancakes. Stack your pancakes three high, top with a pat of butter while still hot and finish with 'Vermont Maid' syrup. YUM!"

If it was primarily in the seats, then what material are your seats?  If they are leather, you are going to need a good scented auto leather cleaner like Touch of Gold.  If the seats are cloth and/or the vomit ended up on the floor, then you will definitely need a heavy duty cleaner and disinfectant.  Lysol will certainly do the trick.  The key is to use as little water as possible, so that you aren't simply spreading it around.  Let it dry completely between cleanings... you should repeat 3 times.  The smell will probably still be there, so it will be a good idea to use carpet fresh just as you would the floors in your home.  Then top it all off with your favorite scent of car air freshener.... I recommend a Car Jar in the Macintosh scent.  you should probably leave your windows cracked during this process so all those smells have a chance to dissipate.. .

Once you've listened to yourself take note of the places you add the Ummm's most, and spend some more time studying that area until you know it without a hitch - re-record over and over until you are certain of your material.

Fact is Oil cant be produced in an unstable country because it is flamable itself and need lots of pipeline to transfer so there must be stable countries in unstable atmosphere.. Middle east has been unstable for many years, USSR and UK has been in territory before WWI and has been replaced by US after that. Israel and Arabs have problems since WWII, Iranians and Arabs have problems even before Islam.... About being poor, apart from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahran, Iran, Iraq, Indonesia, Turkey, Lebonan... there are some poor Islamic countries like Yaman, Afghanestan..... I don't think Islam has been the reason that they are poor, they are mostly countries without resources and good leaders, some of them have been in war since many years ago like Afghanestan.. You can't generalize it, there are many rich Islamic countries and there are poor Islamic countries, you can't say every christian country is rich or every Islamic country is poor.. Proper question is why Islamic countries are not advanced in technology. You can't compare Islamic countries with China, as you know most of resources are in Small countries and they rather buy western cars every year instead of making a automobile factory, you must take it easy on them, you can't force Emarat Arabs to do so, you better know how they are, they even don't explore their oil, western companies do that for them, they don't have an army, western troops protect them, what do you expect of these people? to spend money on science?

You know that science has been emphasized in Islam, there is a Hadith from Mohammad that says \"Learn Sience from cradle to grave\". Like always you have neglected Iran, I have told you, you don't know anything about Iran, there is an Iranian passenger car(Maybe not comparable with BMW but It's not that bad, it can satisfy euro3 standards http://www.ikco.com) and TVs, there are some Iranian TV producers and there are good universities in Iran, they export lots of students each year and we explore our oil ourselves.",

Being agnostic OR atheist does not mean we run from our responsibilities.  Most of us DO live highly ethical lives as according to what we stand for (treating others compassionately, helping others when needed, taking responsibility when required).

Simple as that, honey.  My ethical life has NOTHING to do with the \"god\" issue.. . I am providing a link for you to learn more about agnosticism if you wish to learn more.  If not, no biggie.",

When your nose does start to get dried out in the front of the nasal passage (where drying out due to evaporation is most likely to occur), the mucus that was in there becomes hard and crusty, giving you the classic booger.",

            "Materialism isn't just about financial comfort, it's about status.  Not all American women are materialistic though, as others have mentioned.  Lots of women dig power and confidence, and men who are motivated with a lot of drive.  They're more exciting. Rich dudes tend to be pretty confident, though whether or not they're exciting is another thing.  You gotta consider as well what it would be like to get pregnant and then have a man leave you once you have a child.  Now you need major bucks for diapers and formula AND you gotta work too.  . On the flipside, you could ask why most guys like hot women (I'm a guy and I only date hot women), cause once you've been with some, you don't feel attracted to a woman whose sorta cute or just average.  Lots of women complain about this, but lots of us guys gotta have a hottie, so us men slave at the office, and more and more women better hit the gym to compete with their fitter and healthier counterparts.. To me it's about degree.  If she's really materialistic then forget it, but if she's only a little or somewhat materialistic, then that's tolerable, and that's just life. . You'll often notice a correlation as well between a woman's self-image and degree of materialism.  Generally the more materialistic she is, the lower her is self-image is once you REALLY get to know her.  . Consider her upbringing as well. What kind of life did she have growing up.  Was she a super princess who always got everything?  This is a complex issue, but the bottom line is don't let it get you down... there are lots of ways to a good lady's heart.

I'd like to see half of these snarky nimrods do what I do at least half as good as I do it. Gauranteed they'd quit after the first table, I have NO doubt about that. I make awesome money at what I do.I do it because my children are important to me and I can be with them during the day and work at night when their father comes home, plus I can make alot more money serving than I can working at some office somewhere, infact most of the time I make about as much as my mother does as an LPN nurse.

I am an Airforce veteran, and have gone to school, so you're not talking to a complete idiot here either. If somebody tips me less than 10 percent, I can pretty much chalk it up to them being a tight ass  or a jerk, not because I don't give them my 100 percent. I just kind of laugh and think \"what goes around comes around.\" Thank God that there are  more people out there who give a damn then who don't, to those people THANKYOU...to the rest, sucks to be you!. . . I forgot to add...to all of you who say you cannot afford to tip because you are \"poor\". What praytell are you doing going out to eat in the first place? Stick to fast food or ramen noodles, don't stiff a hardworking server...that's just a lame excuse and it's very selfish to boot.

So since we have two cases of the word we can imply that it covers both in a general way aka lizards. The word great in Hebrew can also mean big or huge so there you have it big lizards. As for the time gap look it also says the sun and the moon were created after the first day but is says that light and the world were created on the first day. This is obviously a mistake. The word for earth is the same world in Hebrew for land (aretz) this can be loosely translated to also mean matter so you can read from this light and then matter were created on the first day.

I)  Saddam had WMD's that were a threat to America. II)  To remove an evil dictator that threatened America. III)  Saddam and the Iraqi gov't were involved in the 9/11 attacks. IV)  To free the Iraqi citizens and spread democracy. V)  To create a more stable, diplomatic, democratic Middle East.... If I've missed any, I'm sure someone will correct me.  . I think the governments reasons probably have less to do with the humanitarian aspect, and more toward oil and spreading American interests.  Truthfully, I don't know why for sure, I just know what I've been told.  Only the President and his cabinet know the reasons..they just tell the media what they want the American public to know."

However, up till today they still have not found any WMDs there nor any proof that WMDs were manufactured in iraq. It is now belived that those reasons are just a cover up. Also, the way the soldiers treat the iraqis puts doubt in ones mind as that certainly isnt the way to liberate the people. The real reason is believed to be oil. the price of oil was increasing and america needed more control over oil recources. It is also believed that G.Bush needed to show that he was indeed takin measures against terrorism as the media was reporting how he failed the country on numerous occasions such as 9/11 and this would help raise his status again. But for all we know he might just not like iraqis. Hope this helps.",

If not go with science diet food for kittens.  Just make sure it's for kittens.   But no milk, no chocolate, no sweets, makes them very sick and extremely hard to digest and harmful.   If the cat needs milk go with a kitten formula sold at the pet stores.  good luck hun   Oh, and no table scarps also very difficult for babies.",

            "Butterfinger is the name of a candy bar made by Nestlé. It has a firm, orange-colored center similar in texture and taste to peanut brittle (without the peanuts), that is coated in milk chocolate. The filling has a peanut butter taste, hence the name. When eaten, it tends to crumble and then take on a peanut buttery consistency.. Butterfinger was invented by the Curtiss Candy Company of Chicago, Illinois in 1923. The company held a public contest to choose the name of the candy bar. The name is a slang term used to describe a clumsy person, often in sporting events to describe an athlete who can't hold onto the ball. As an early publicity stunt and marketing ploy, the company dropped Butterfinger and Baby Ruth candy bars from airplanes in cities across the United States which helped increase its popularity.. One of the slogans currently used to advertise the candy bar is \"Break out of the ordinary!\" Prior to that, Bart Simpson and other characters from The Simpsons appeared in numerous advertisements for the product from 1989 to 2001, with the slogan \"Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!\". Butterfinger was withdrawn from German shops due to consumer rejection when it was one of the first products to be labeled as containing genetically modified ingredients from corn.. After a series of mergers and acquisitions, the candy bar is now produced by Nestlé.",

Jewish people or anyone do not take offense but the WAR had greater repercussions than the Holocaust itself - here's why.... Estimates are that 6 million Jews were exterminated, worked to death, murdered in Europe.  The end state was that Jews created Israel in 1948.. Now compare the number of Chinese, Russian (and Slavs of Eastern Europe), German, French, Japanese that died totaling in the hundreds of millions.. The Holocaust was spurned by a decision of the Nazis to rid Europe of Jews as quickly as possible.  This decision (arguably) didn't have a huge bearing on how the Allies would fight the war and defeat Germany and Japan (unconditional surrender from the beginning).. Comparisons - how many tribes/people did Ghengis Khan crush rolling through out of the Asian steppe?  How many north African tribes (originally from Europe) were wiped out by invading Arabs in the early Middle Ages?  How many Chinese did good 'ole Mao kill or starve to death in the 1960s?  How many Russians and Soviets died under glorious Stalin over a thirty year reign? (Both killed more people than Hitler). My point is that no matter in what conflict, humans have always reached some level of absolute barbarism and lose total value in human life (more recently the Khomer Rouge (sp?) in Cambodia, Milosevic in former-Yugoslavia, Saddam in Iraq/Iran and today, Darfur).  . Unfortunately, there aren't many positive LONG term effects to make much difference after human atrocities occured.  At least not many difference makers that have been successful.  The SHORT term goals are usually very good - criminal trials of the accused, memorials/museums to the deceased/fallen.  . Bottom Line - World War II resulted in many global changes, lessons to be learned from the Holocaust have largely been forgotten...Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, China (over decades since), sub-Saharan Africa (Rwanda, Somalia, Darfur), Yugoslavia, former-USSR, Iran/Iraq War, etc etc...human atrocities will likely continue...",

        "answer": [
            "You shouldn't. Not at first anyway. Wittgenstein spent a lot of time, arguing or disagreeing with people, so read other first.. Like Tolstoy, or Descartes, or Dostoevsky. . Perhaps, Plato if you want the basis for most of western Philosophy. Descartes for the re-animation of Philosophical thought. Perhaps Heraclitus, for some real old-school Pre-Socratian Philosophy. A J Ayer, & the Gettier counter-examples, the basis for modern thought into knowledge itself (well worth a read, espeacially the Gettier counter-examples to Justified True Belief. Not hard to find, it's the only paper he ever published).... . The list is endless. Just don't start off with Wittgenstein. If you start with him, & he becomes your basis for philosophical writing, you'll find it hard motivating yourself to read philosophy.",
            "Wittgenstein is not the first philosopher you should read. there are others whose contribution is more basic to the subject as well as easier to understand. These include Descartes, Locke, Hume and Mill. Amongst Wittgenstein's contemporaries they include Russell and Quine. In addition, Ryle's book \"The Concept of Mind\", published just before Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\", is also highly influential as an argument aginst \"The ghost in the machine\", and is much more readable.. . Having placed Wittgenstein in context, his work is essential reading if you are to understand twentieth century philosophy, particuarly the philosophy of mind and of language, both of which have been crucial for twentieth century advances in thought. This applies both to Wittgenstein's earlier work, the \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" with its picture theory of truth and the \"Philosophical Investigations\" which overturned Wittgenstein's earlier ideas with the notion of the language game.. . Wittgenstein is difficult to read, or rather to understand. You will need to read one, and probably several, of the many introductions to his works before approaching his main texts, and it will greatly help to go to lectures and/or tutorials on Wittgenstein. One reason is that Wittgenstein believed that philosophical works should stand on their own merit, and as a consequence the influence of previous philosophical thought on his work, for instance Augustine, Frege and Russell, is not always obvious.. . A further issue is that Wittgenstein's own ideas gave rise to a belief that the philosopher's personal life is irrelevant to his (or her) thought This belief has been followed by many more recent philosophers, but in Wittgenstein's own case it is very problematic. Wittgenstein's own life was remarkable in many ways, and deeply tortured. It may have led to inluences on his work that neither Wittgenstein nor his interpreters fully appreciate or wish to admit if they do. For this reason I would strongly suggest that you read the standard biography, \"Wittgenstein\" by Ray Monk, before or alongside your philsophical reading on Wittgenstein."

I assume you have a purpose for reading him or is this more or less recreational?  \"Here is a hand\" is a famous proposition he went on to examine, in his work On Certainty.",

This takes care of the rust and debris in the tank and if you have ever put any solid objects in the tank like my kids have you will know how hard they can be to get out. The ice melts and drains right out. Be sure that once you start with the water you do not stop until it is rinsed out with gas as this will promote the rust if you do. If at any point you fell a weak spot in the metal of the tank stop because the tank will not hold up and this could be potentially fatal.",

            "Thirteen is a very magickal number. Most pagans see it as a lucky number .  most ancients who did not practice folk magick were in awe and fear of the number thirteen. even so in ancient Egypt thirteen was a lucky number and also in china. thirteen is also the number of the moon goddess and a feminine number. when male dominance and a solar calender of twelve appeared many abandoned the number thirteen. of course many think the superstition came from the vikings. A party of the gods was held and one god named Loki was uninvited he would have been the thirteenth person. this angered him so much that he killed the god of joy. thus the vikings came to say t6hat it is unlucky to have thirteen people in a room.",
            "The solar calendar is 12 is hardly a \"male dominated\" calendar, even if we were to assume that all sun deities are male, or all moon deities are female (Amatarasu the Japanese sun goddess, or Teccuciztecatl, the Aztec moon god, for example). The reason why there are 12 months in the European solar calendar is because the months roughly follow the cycle of the moon. If the inventors of the \"male dominated\" solar calendar didn't care about the feminine moon, they would have based their months on something else.. . To address the actual question, however, 13 is only unlucky in certain cultures. Each culture has their own ideas on what numbers are lucky or unlucky, based on things attributed to that number. Apparently, it wasn't even considered unlucky in Christianity at first. Try this link:. . http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_080.html. . For a little less sarcastic reading, I suggest this link, it's part of a larger article about why Friday the 13th is considered unlucky, but this part focuses on the number 13, so it might lend some insight to your question.. . http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/historical/a/friday_the_13th_2.htm. . A good example of cultures that saw the number 13 as a good thing would be the Aztec and Maya, but Shepen already gave a good explanation as to why that is."
