Therefore, there will be less molecules in an equal volume of the hot air than the original volume of cold air.. .

In the atmosphere, the rising air is called a 'Thermal' which is used by gliders, hang-gliders and soaring birds to get the lift.. . This principle is also used in domestic heating where the convection currents circulate the warm air around a room.. . (Convection currents are also set up in liquids)",

Also, since the air is so much thinner at high altitude the resistance against the aircraft (drag) is much reduced, meaning they jet burns less fuel for the same effect. This translates into much better fuel economy, leaving more money per mile for the airline. Also, airliners cruise at different altitudes with a minimum 500' of separation.

It is generally the severe sore throat that prompts people to contact their doctor. . . What are the signs of \"mono?\" . . In addition to a fever from 102 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, the most common signs of \"mono\" are:. . a very reddened throat and tonsils and . swollen lymph glands in the neck. . The tonsils have a whitish coating in at least one third of the cases. The spleen, (sometimes referred to as the body's biggest lymph node), is an organ found in the left upper abdomen underneath the ribcage which becomes enlarged or swollen in about 50% of patients with \"mono.\" An enlarged liver may also occur. About 5% of patients have a splotchy red rash over the body, which has a similar appearance to the rash of measles. . . How is \"mono\" diagnosed? . . The diagnosis of \"mono\" is suspected by the doctor based on the above symptoms and signs. \"Mono\" is confirmed by blood tests while testing to exclude other possible causes of the symptoms. Early in the course of the illness, blood tests show an increase in a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte). Some of these increased lymphocytes are unusual or \"atypical\" lymphocytes, which suggest \"mono.\" More specific testing, such as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests, can confirm the diagnosis of \"mono.\" These tests rely on the body's immune system to make measurable antibodies against the EBV. Unfortunately, the antibodies may not become detectable until the second or third weeks of the illness. A blood chemistry test can reveal abnormalities in liver function. Testing to exclude the possibility of a strep throat is also considered for some patients."

            "BLACK FRIDAY (SHOPPING) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_Sale. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. . Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving in the United States, is historically one of the busiest retail shopping days of the year. Many consider it the \"official\" beginning to the holiday season. Most retailers will open very early and usually provide massive discounts on their products.. . Although Black Friday is typically the busiest shopping day of the year in terms of customer traffic, it is not typically the day with the highest sales volume. That is usually either Christmas Eve or the last Saturday before Christmas.. . Origin. . The first use of this term to describe the day after Thanksgiving is not exactly known. There are two popular theories as to its origin.. . Accounting practice. . One theory is that stores traditionally operated at a financial loss for most of the year (January through November) and made their profit during the holiday season. When this would be recorded in the financial records, common accounting practices use red ink to show negative amounts and black ink would show positive amounts. Black Friday is the beginning of the period where they would no longer have losses (the red) and instead take in the year's profits (the black).. . Stress from large crowds. . Another theory comes from the fact that shopping experience on this day can be extremely stressful. The term is used as a comparison to the extremely stressful and chaotic experience of Black Thursday or other black days. According to The Word Spy:. . Earliest Citation:. Christmas decorations around Tampa Bay started going up in late October, and business has been brisk since then. And while Friday--known as Black Friday for the legendary hordes--will be the biggest shopping day for many area stores, others ring up the greatest sales the Saturday before Christmas.. —Marilyn Marks, \"Retailers expect good sales this Christmas,\" St. Petersburg Times, November 27, 1986. . There exists an earlier reference, speaking to the Friday after Thanksgiving:. . A BLACK FRIDAY.. There have been many Black Fridays in recent history. Most of them have been days of financial panic. There has been none of blacker foreboding than last Friday. And the blackness is not loss or fear of loss in stocks and bonds.. New York Times (1857-Current file).. New York, N.Y.: Dec 3, 1922. pg. 38, 1 pgs. ISSN/ISBN 03624331. . Employees of retail stores have for years referred to Black Friday in a satirical way, to note the extremely stressful and hectic nature of the day. Heavy traffic and customer demands added to the long hours make it a difficult day.. . . Black Friday on the Internet. . Advertisements in advance. . Certain websites such as DealTaker.com offer information about Black Friday deals up to a month in advance. The text listings of prices are usually accompanied by adscans -- complete PDFs either leaked by insiders, or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.. . Cyber Monday. . The term Cyber Monday refers to the Monday immediately following Black Friday, which unofficially marks the beginning of the holiday online shopping season.. . In recent years, Cyber Monday has become a busy day for online retailers, with some sites offering low prices and other promotions on that day.. . Controversy. . Response (Buy Nothing Day). .

        "answer": [
            "Hi Friend. . While both light and sound travel as waves, the speed of light is much, much faster.. . Light is composed of electromagnetic waves which travel independent of a medium. That is to say, light can travel in a vacuum, such as outer space. Electromagnetic waves travel very fast. In a vacuum, the speed is 300,000,000 meters per second; the maximum speed which energy may obtain. This value is abbreviated as \"c\" , and you may have seen it before as part of Einstein's equation E=mc2. However, when light passes through transparent materials, it slows down a bit. This is because electromagnetic waves interact with the subatomic components of matter. In water, for example, light slows down to around 0.75c, or 225,000,000 meters per second. Even in a material as dense as diamond light travels well over 100 million meters per second! . . Sound is created by small changes in pressure near the surface of a vibrating object. These changes are propagated through a material medium, such as air, like the ripples formed when one tosses a stone into a pool of water. Sound travels through air at about 340 meters per second. In contrast to light, sound often travels faster in dense materials. In liquid water, sound travels 1450 meters per second. And, in metals such as iron, sounds can travel well over 5000 meters per second. While this is about ten times the speed of a supersonic jet airplane, it is only a tiny fraction of the speed of light.",
            "light always travels at a speed of 299,792,458 meters per second.  . The speed of sound actuall varies depending upon temperature, altitude, and many other things.  . HEre is a formula i got from a website:. . . \"Speed of Sound . You can measure the speed of sound the same way you measure the speed of a runner, with a stopwatch on a closed track.. . Find a place where you can hear a good echo, and stand a known distance from whatever the sound is reflecting off of. . Fire a starter's pistol and start the stopwatch. Stop the watch when you hear the echo. . Divide 2 times the distance (it's a round trip) by the time to get the speed.. . At 21 degrees C (70°F), you should get 344 meters per second, or 1129 ft per second. At freezing, the numbers are 331 m/s or 1087 ft/s. The proper formula for the change in speed due to temperature is:. . . . Where T is degrees Celsius. The works out to about a 0.1% change per degree Fahrenheit.. . The Speed of sound in water is 1480 m/s or 4856 ft/s. More than 3000 miles per hour.\""

First off, all will agree that the audio in a commercial is generally very loud. 2ndly, when a show \"fades to black\" to go to commercial, both the video and the audio portion are faded down to zero.  So, when the commercial comes on, it sounds like it's much louder than the show you were watching. What you are hearing is the loudness difference between the quiet part of the show fading to black, and the commercial coming on \"balls to the wall\".  Additionally, when the show has a very loud scene going on, like a chase scene, it's no quieter than the commercials. The commercials just \"seem\" louder because of the way human ears work.

        "answer": [
            "In the early days, people believes that your soul will leave your body if you sneeze.. . How or why did saying \"God bless you\" become associated as an expression one says to another after the other sneezes? Some reasons listed below, but, somehow, I don't think any of them are very legitimate:. . * When someone sneezes his heart stops and saying \"God bless you\" means \"I'm glad your heart started again.\". * Saying \"God bless you\" when you sneeze keeps the devil from flying down your throat.. * When someone sneezes, say \"God bless you and may the devil miss you.\". * When you sneeze your soul tries to escape and saying \"God bless you\" crams it back in (said by Millhouse in an episode of The Simpsons).",
            "\"Roman paganism contributed the traditional \"God bless you\" or Gesundheit (May you have health) offered to one who sneezed.  The old expression was \"Jupiter preserve you\" or \"Jupiter help me\"  Its basis was the ancient Indo-European concept of the air-soul or breath-soul (Atman), which might be expelled from the body by a violent rush of air unless prevented by a verbal charm.  Covering the mouth during a yawn arose from the same fear of losing the soul.  Medieval churchmen accepted the superstition, and taught that both sneezing and yawning should be immediately protected by the sign of the cross, because \"Ofttimes a man sneezed, and expired at the moment of sneezing...In like manner it often befell that man yawned, and fell dead.\""

His drink becomes popular with New Yorkers but something is missing. The hotel asks him to change the name to the Red Snapper, but it doesn't catch on and it is again called the Bloody Mary. His patrons encourage him to make the drink spicy, so he adds cayenne pepper, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, lemon, and a big dash of Tabasco® sauce. The recipe is a hit.. . March 30, 1956: George Jessel takes out an ad in Collier's that reads: “I think I invented The Bloody Mary, Red Snapper, Tomato Pickup or Morning Glory. It happened on a Night before a Day and I felt I should take some good, nourishing tomato juice, but what I really wanted was some of your good Smirnoff Vodka. So I mixed them together, the juice for body and the vodka for spirit, and if I wasn't the first ever, I was the happiest ever.”. . Aug. 15, 1956: The Bloody Mary is mentioned in Punch magazine: \"Those two ... are eating raw steaks and drinking Bloody Marys.”. . July 18, 1964: Petiot tells the New Yorker: \"I initiated the Bloody Mary of today. George Jessel said he created it, but it was really nothing but vodka and tomato juice when I took it over. I cover the bottom of the shaker with four large dashes of salt, two dashes of black pepper, two dashes of cayenne pepper, and a layer of Worcestershire sauce; I then add a dash of lemon juice and some cracked ice, put in two ounces of vodka and two ounces of thick tomato juice, shake, strain, and pour. We serve a hundred to a hundred and fifty Bloody Marys a day here in the King Cole Room and in the other restaurants and the banquet rooms.\". . Jan. 8, 1975: Petiot dies in San Francisco.. . 1976: The McIlhenny Company introduces Tabasco® Bloody Mary Mix.",

If they fail to keep their muscles and bones active, they can experience painful damage to the muscles and even early signs of osteoperosis, the deterioration of bone mass that people on earth experience when they don't have enough calcuim, which can lead to injuring the bone.

        "answer": [
            "yawning is contagious....we yawn when we are bored and also when there is inadequate oxygen. this can happen (shortage of oxygen) especially in a room full of people. since oxygen is less we yawn to take in more air (oxygen) which our body requires. and since oxygen is generally in lower levels, other people start yawning aswell.",
            "The yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, this will cause another person to \"sympathetically\" yawn.[3] The proximate cause for contagious yawning may lie with mirror neurons, i.e. neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates, which upon being exposed to a stimulus from conspecific (same species) and occasionally interspecific organisms, activates the same regions in the brain[4]. Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for Imitation which lies at the root of much human learning, e.g. language acquisition. Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse. At a distal level (in terms of evolutionary advantage), yawning might be a herd instinct.[5] Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood behavior among gregarious animals, similar to the howling of the wolf pack during a full moon. It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods of activity. It can serve as a warning in displaying large, canine teeth. This phenomenon has been observed among various primates. The threat gesture is a way of maintaining order in the primates' social structure. The contagion of yawning is interspecific, for example a human yawning in front of a pet dog can incite the dog to yawn as well. Oddly, sometimes sympathetic yawning may be caused by simply looking at a picture of a person or animal yawning, or even seeing the word yawn.. .

            "4_4": "It may not be one of life’s deepest mysteries, but as scientific conundrums go, it has a peculiar staying power. Why is yawning contagious? .   Researchers recently found that yawning isn’t only catching among people; it is also among chimpanzees.No one has devised a fully convincing explanation of why.. . Compounding the mystery is the odd way in which the contagious power of yawning is largely unconscious. We can see someone yawn, yearn to replicate the action ourselves, and do it, all without thinking about it. Other times we’re aware it is happening, though it still floats somewhere beneath the realm of reason and of purposeful actions.. . So what gives? In an effort to find the answer, the Finnish government recently funded a brain scanning study. The results turned up some hard-to-interpret, possible clues. It also confirmed the obvious: yawn contagion is largely unconscious. Wherever it might affect the brain, it bypasses the known brain circuitry for consciously analyzing and mimicking other people’s actions.. . This circuitry is called the “mirror-neuron system,” because it contains a special type of brain cells, or neurons, that become active both when their owner does something, and when he or she senses someone else doing the same thing. . . Mirror neurons typically become active when a person consciously imitates an action of someone else, a process associated with learning. But they seem to play no role in yawn contagiousness, the researchers in the new study found. The cells are have no extra activity during contagious yawning compared with during other non-contagious facial movements, they observed.. . Brain activity “associated with viewing another person yawn seems to circumvent the essential parts of the MNS [mirror neuron system], in line with the nature of contagious yawns as automatically released behavioural acts—rather than truly imitated motor patterns that would require detailed action understanding,” wrote the researchers, with the Helsinki University of Technology and the Research Centre Jülich, Germany. The findings are published in the February issue of the research journal Neuroimage.. . But if seeing someone yawn doesn’t activate these centers, what does it do to the brain? The researchers found that it appears to strongly activate at least one brain area, called the superior temporal sulcus. But this activation was unrelated to any desire to yawn in response, so it may be irrelevant to the contagion question, the researchers added.. . Possibly more significant, they wrote, was the apparent deactivation of a second brain area, called the left periamygdalar region. The more strongly a participant reported wanting to yawn in response to another person’s yawn, the stronger was this deactivation. . . “This finding represents the first known neurophysiological signature of perceived yawn contagiousness,” the researchers wrote.. . Exactly what the finding means is less clear, they acknowledged. The periamygdalar region is a zone that lies alongside the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure deep in the brain in the area of the side of the head. The periamygdalar region has been linked to the unconscious analysis of emotional expressions in faces. Why it would be deactivated in tandem with yawn contagion is unclear, the researchers said.. . One thing seems clear from the study is that “contagious yawning does not rely on brain mechanisms of action understanding,” wrote one of the researchers, Riitta Hari of the Helsinki University of Technology, in a recent email. Rather, she continued, it seems to be an “‘automatically’ released (and most likely very archaic) motor pattern,” or sequence of physical actions.. . In the study, volunteers looked at videos of actors yawning or making other mouth movements. Meanwhile their brains were scanned using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a system that shows the amount of activity or work going on in various brain areas ba",

And plus it is pretty amusing when you have a yawn fest with someone and just cannot stop yawning back and forth.. Hope this helps!",

Oil on the other hand is already in the ground and is pipelined to a place where it can be pumped into ships, trucks, or barrels. It doesn't need to stay cold and lasts forever. It can be transported without the expense of individual packages. Contrary to what many think today, there are still abundant supplies of it.

A long time ago the earth was hot because the atmoshpere had great amounts of CO2. Mother nature slowly found a way to trap that CO2 in the form of fossil fuels deep with in the earth.

We kept ours in the bathroom so we had one litter box.

            "1_3": "Today it is just  a fun tradition to color Easter Eggs  - historically:. . Intricate Easter egg designs date back centuries. The decoration of Easter eggs to further enhance their value became an art form centuries ago and continues today. Dyes made from vegetables, edible flowers, fruits, coffee, tea, leaves, bark, and roots were used to tint the eggs. Lovely designs were created by wrapping the eggs in ferns before tinting. The art progressed, with western Europeans becoming expert at creating intricate patterns in vibrant colors on the small eggs. . . Here are explanations of some of the many types of decorated eggs: . . • Etched: Traced back to Macedonia, this process involves dying the egg, applying a layer of wax in a design, then bleaching off the color leaving only the wax-covered areas with color.. . • Krashanky: The Ukrainian word means color, and these eggs are dyed a solid, brilliant color, often red to symbolize the blood shed by Christ on the cross.. . • Fabergé: Probably some of the most famous and most expensive Easter eggs known are those created by Russian jeweler Peter Carl Fabergé in the 1800's. The eggs were made of gold, silver and jewels and most opened up to reveal exquisite tiny figures of people, animals, plants or buildings. A total of 57 eggs were made. These are obviously museum artifacts of high value.. . • Jeweled: Designs are created by gluing any manner of sequins, beads, flowers, etc., onto blown eggs.. . • Cut-Out or Carved: Blown eggs are used also for these creations where a portion of the shell is cut away. The exterior is decorated, and the inside filled with a little scene to be viewed through the cut-out section. These can be exquisitely elaborate."

Overproduction of collagen is associated with injury to the skin. It is a direct response of the skin to injury. Excessive collagen forms fibrous masses which results in typical acne scar.. . A drug recommended by many dermatologists for the worst cases of acne scars is Accutane. It is the wonder drug of the 21st century to prevent acne scarring in acne sufferers.. .

When the brain receives an impulse of something that is reoccuring over and over again, it will store it as a memory so it will be remembered. So memory is mainly a series of nerve impulses and the storing of information in the nuclei in the cells of the brain that relay information between the parts of the limbic system and the cerebral cortex so that memories can be stored and recalled."

For example, if a smell is to be recognized and to be kept in memory, nerve impulses from the olfactory tract would travel to the limbic system of the brain; this system is made up of the hippocampus, thalamus, and the amygdala which control a person's memory. When the brain receives an impulse of something that is reoccuring over and over again, it will store it as a memory so it will be remembered. So memory is mainly a series of nerve impulses and the storing of information in the nuclei in the cells of the brain that relay information between the parts of the limbic system and the cerebral cortex so that memories can be stored and recalled.",

        "answer": [
            "Sin is the affect of an earlier problem.Sin occurs mainly after temptation has been acted upon by our spirit and body.Sin is something that if not repented of will lead to death not in the bodily sense alone but spiritual as well.\"The second death\" as it is called is what punishment is aquired for the acummulation of unrepented sin.Actually if a person is baptized into Christ and has repented and living the Christian life as best they can there will still be sin.Thing is we then have the privledge to ask forgiveness of sins as long as we try not to sin which is what repent actually broken down means.To turn from sin.Sin actually is no worse than another sin for instance Christ only really spoke of one and that is blasphemy and it is the worst of all.Sexual sin is a biggy but only because when you are baptized into Christ's body then you have the holy spirit within you.So having sex you are involving the holy spirit which lives inside of you which is definetly not good.Sin for the most part is equal.For instance some so called christians say that homosexuality is worse than other sins but in reality if I looked upon a woman sexually it is no worse than if a man looks at another man that way or vice versa.Just remember that sin is an act not something we are born with as calvinists and catholics believe.A baby that cannot walk talk or have sex cannot sin!Therefore it doesnt need baptism as a baby as they say besides a baby cannot confess Christ as Lord nor repent of sins for it has none.Hope this helps",

When the  certain molecules vibrate at the same frequency (speed, size) as a specific type of light, the molecules will absorb that light and either reflect it or release it as heat (usually a combination).  . High energy UV light is bad for your eyes, but visible spectrum light is necessary to see.  Sunglasses are composed of materials that absorb/reflect light in the UV spectrum but allow visible light to pass through to you eyes.  Typically some of the visible light is absorbed as well, which is why the world appears in a different color or is darker.  . . To give an example, purple light is very similar in wavelength to UV light, so it would to be a huge stretch to find that your UV filtering sunglasses also filter purple light.  B/c colors are a mixture of light, all of the colors that you look at would be without purple, which would change their color as you see it.",

UV light has enough energy to \"glue\" another atom to O2, but that energy is transfered to the ozone, and UV light looses it, so it gets bigger wavelength, lower frequency, which turns UV into visible light, that is harmless to the living creatures.",

            "Self Distraction to prevent premature ejaculation . If your arousal levels are getting too high and a climax is beginning, take a deep breath and think about something else, something very boring if possible. When you are less aroused but maintaining an erection you can then continue. . . Stop and Start Method for premature ejaculation. If you find yourself nearing climax withdraw your penis from your partner and allow yourself to relax enough to prevent ejaculation. By starting and stopping sexual stimulation you can learn to prolong the sex act.. . Squeeze Methods can help prevent premature ejaculation. This method involves either the man or his partner squeezing (fairly firmly) the end or the tip of the penis for 10 to 20 seconds when ejaculation is imminent, withholding stimulation for about 30 seconds, then continuing stimulation. This can be repeated until ejaculation is desired. The stop and start method can be used with the squeeze method as well.. . Desensitizing Creams for premature ejaculation. Creams can be used to desensitize the end of the penis. They act like a local or tropical anesthetic. Thicker condoms (or two condoms) can also desensitize by decreasing sensitivity and therefore stimulation, thus prolonging the sexual act.. . More Foreplay prevents premature ejaculation. Stimulate your partner to a state of high arousal before you have your genitals touched, that way ejaculation and orgasm can be achieved about the same time.. . Masturbation to prevent premature ejaculation. Practice different methods by yourself. Getting to know your feelings and sensations gives you the chance to gain confidence.. . Remember getting good at sex and overcoming premature ejaculation can take a bit of time. Practice makes perfect.

They all stop fighting each other for a while, beat the invader, and then go back to killing each other. Its just they way they are and always have been.. . Therefore the idea is that the US and Brit forces over there are transitional into a NATO force, and eventually U.N force to \"assist\" the new government with security. Not to prosecute a war.. . Iraq is similar, but with the added subtelty that it is acting as a magnet for anti western lunatics everywhere to come and have a crack at the U.S and her allies.. . What I believe the strategy is, is that the allies are allowing this to happen as the current rate of attrition is 70 - 100 insurgents killed for every allied soldier killed or wounded.. . In any war that is an acceptable battlefield ratio and one where the west is winning.

Heroic soldiers execute with pefection a plan to track down and eliminate Zarqawi.  Despite this perfect execution, it will not ammount to much change  in Iraq.  40 people were killed and 120 people wounded yesterday despite the actions against Zaraqawi.  . . The reason is this will ammount to no change is that the plan is wrong.  The Bush Administration and millitary brass have put our soldiers into a situation where they cannot succeed.  They can't figure out who is helping and who is the enemy.  This situation could have easily been predicted at the outset of the war with the ethnic make-up of the area and the lack of infrastructure outside of the iron fist of Sadam.  For reasons that are unclear, no one prepared for this kind of war after Sadam was toppled.  I predict we will eventually have Iran 2 for Iraq.  . . It is wonderful that they got Zarqawi, unfortunately it will hardly put dent in the violence.  It might not even chip the paint.",

We wouldn't have an issue if we were told the truth and they were honest with us. There is nothing but backhandedness going on in that White House and look who you're quoting...fox news. Yeah they're balanced...sure they are. There are plenty of republicans out there that are also fed up with the lies that this administration has told us. It's not a matter of whether or not Kerry won...that's done and over with. I haven't heard too many people complaining about Kerry not winning until I listen to people like you. I'm aware of the article Rolling stone did about the \"voting problems\" in Ohio. Maybe you should read that and then make an informed decision.

I'm not saying I want them to be made but if we signed an agreement which we did, shouldn't we be following it too? Would it be ok if someone else invaded our country because there is a possibility for manufacturing WMD's",

If the coin were hammered into a thin bowl then, although the metal is more dense than water it would be spread across a wider area and it would displace less than its own weight in water, so it would float. That's why metal ships float. The wood is naturally less dense than water so it floats on water.",

        "answer": [
            "STD has various types...and you cant just take any medicines to treat it. you have to see a doctor for a proper treatment if you wanna live longer.  prolong exposure to std will/might develope HIV due to prolong infection in your body so its up to you.....:). . . Sexually transmitted diseases, commonly called STDs, are infections that are spread by having sex with someone who has an STD. You can get a sexually transmitted disease from sexual activity that involves the mouth, anus or vagina.. . STDs are serious illnesses that require treatment, regardless of whether or not you are pregnant. But, when you are pregnant, you are not the only one at risk; many STDs can be especially harmful to you and your baby. Some STDs, like HIV/AIDS, cannot be cured and are deadly.. . Your health care provider will likely screen for some STDs at your first prenatal visit , but if you have sex with someone who is infected, you will need to be screened at subsequent appointments and treated. If you suspect you have an STD, be sure to tell your doctor immediately. Fast treatment is the best way to protect you and your baby.. . STDs include:. .     * Herpes.     * HIV/AIDS.     * Genital warts (caused by human papilloma virus, or HPV).     * Hepatitis B.     * Chlamydia.     * Syphilis.     * Gonorrhea.     * Vaginitis . . What Are the Symptoms of STDs?. . Sometimes, there are no symptoms. If symptoms are present, they may include:. .     * Bumps, sores or warts near the mouth, anus, penis or vagina.     * Swelling or redness near the penis or vagina.     * Skin rash.     * Painful urination.     * Weight loss, loose stool, night sweats.     * Aches, pains, fever and chills.     * Yellowing of the skin (jaundice).     * Discharge from the penis or vagina (vaginal discharge may have an odor).     * Bleeding from the vagina other than during a monthly period.     * Painful sex.     * Severe itching near the penis or vagina. . How Can I Find Out If I Have an STD?. . At your prenatal visit, your health care provider will screen for a number of STDs. But, if you think you have an STD, tell your provider. He or she can examine you and perform other tests to determine if you have a sexually transmitted disease.. . How Can I Protect Myself From STDs?. . Here are some basic steps that you can take to protect yourself from contracting STDs:. .     * Consider that not having sex is the only sure way to prevent STDs..     * Use a latex condom every time you have sex. (If you use a lubricant, make sure it is water-based.).     * Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have the more likely you are to catch an STD..     * Practice monogamy. This means having sex with only one person. That person must also have sex with only you to reduce your risk..     * Choose your sex partners with care. Don't have sex with someone whom you suspect may have an STD..     * Get checked for STDs. Don't risk giving the infection to someone else or your baby. Just because you've been screened for STDs early on in your pregnancy, does not mean that you can't contract one later during your pregnancy. If you engage in unprotected sex with more than one partner since your last STD screen, you need another set of screening tests. Also, you should be concerned if your partner is having unprotected sex with other people..     * If you have more than one sex partner, always use a condom..     * Don't use alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high. Plus, alcohol and drugs can harm your developing baby..     * Know the signs and symptoms of STDs. Look for them in yourself and your sex partners..     * Learn about STDs. The more you know about STDs, the better you can protect yourself.. . How Can I Prevent Spreading a STD?. .     * Stop having sex until you see a health care provider and are treated..     * Follow your health care provider's instructions for treatment..     * Use condom",

        "question": "why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?",
        "answer": [
            "I think the laws have become extreme and although I can see why they are there to prevent passive-smoking, they inhibit people's freedom at the same time.. . There is so much campaign out there to stop people from smoking full stop and not just in pubs but at the workplace too.  I guess this is good when fires can be started from not puting out a cigarrette and that makes sense.  . . But if they are going to ban smoking they may as well ban drinking when there so many accidents on the roads relating to drink.  . . They may as well ban anything that is seen as a threat to human life itself because the way we are going, we are going to be dead anyway from all of the pollution and global warming! - so, yes, I think that banning smoking is ridiculous when governments won't fork out money they tax us, to stop the effects of global warming. . . Instead they tax us more for the problems that they have created!",
            "I agree with you. Although I am not a smoker, we don't ban alcohol or other things that could ''POSSIBLY IN THE LONG RUN CAUSE YOU HARM'', why do they get away with doing that to tobacco...how about Potato Chips????"

I am a smoker and to some degree I understand the smoking in restaurants due to children and expecting mothers but in bars???  come on it is all adults who are there to get their drink on and what is a drink without a cig. BORING! . . SECOND: We The People - are going to lose our freedom, our rights, and our democracy status  the ban on smoking started in a small area and now it is nation wide and beyond ( Castro banned cigar smoking in public areas) go figure!  The ignorant are all proud of the ban success which is leading to what is now-pro-life vs pro-choice-. In South Dakota the Governor banned abortions and any doctor caught performing one will automatically serve 5 years in prison. now wait-the law there stipulates that a woman can ONLY have an abortion if it is life threatening to her.  If she becomes pregnant by rape or incest then she must carry the baby to term!!!!!!. WE woman are still considered second class citizens what the hell will we become if we are stripped of our rights!!!!!  TO CHOOSE.

Remember, what makes the news is generally an isolated case, but it has been generalized to sound like common practice. At the same time, there are many different educational systems and criteria that it is hard to make comparisons. For example, as a general rule, most US universities will not consider a candidate for a Master's program if the Bachelor's was completed in less than 4 years. Countries that follow the British educational style will have spent a period of \"pre-university\" that can take up to 2 years before taking the final exams for the chosen papers. Then, completion of a Bachelor's degree takes only 3 years. To compare with the American system, we have the general education subjects before specialization tends to occur. In effect, bith systems are doing the same thing, it's a hang up about the time factor or classification of an area with which most are not familiar.. . Another idea to help keep in mind, for professional types of degrees and qualifications, each country has specific ideas as to what should be in the curriculum. For example, medical schools also empasize patient care and communication as part and parcel. Other countries medical degrees take less time as they empasize more on pathology and diagnosis. . . One more thing to remember, in the US we don't have a national standard. The US universities are independent and may not even accept credits from another US university. Many universities DO offer bridging programs where should you not meet the tradtitional requirements for a master's degree, you can apply your experience as well as take a few subjects you lack to re-evaluate your situation. Thos means you won't have to repeat everything - just fill in the gaps in your education that do not meet the standards of a particular university.",

Success in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.. . I am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer don't want you to know about.. . Before I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. . . So how does your body burn fat?. . It is a two steps process and in order to lose body fat you need to:. . 1.Release the fat from the fat cells and only then. 2.You can burn the fat. . How does your body release the fat from the cells?. . Before you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.. . 1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.. 2.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods. 3.Eat lean proteins with each meal.. 4.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.. 5.Drink plenty of water. . . How does your body burn the fat? . . If you started exercising and then reached a plateau, you have probably burned more muscle tissue than fat with your workout. This is the worst thing that could happen.. . Let me explain. . . Less Muscle = slower metabolism = Weight loss plateau. Then you end up in the yo-yo dieting bandwagon.. . How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.. . You need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. . Doing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime . soon. Here is what you need to do:. . 1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate. 2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...). . Your muscle tissue is your best friend when it comes to burn body fat. You need to preserve muscle tissues in order to keep losing weight. Most people go on a starvation diet combined a lot of cardio to lose weight. At first it may seems like this is working because they are losing scale weight. . . Now think about, scale weight does not tell you if weight loss is from fat, water or muscle tissue. Scale weight by itself is not a good indicator of success.. . To maintain muscle tissues you need to:. 1.Do some resistance training. (This is not optional, it is mandatory). . . The secret. . Now that you understand the whole fat burning process, I am going to reveal to you how celebrity personal trainers do to get those amazing transformations. The strategy is to combine all the steps that I outlined so the body works as a unit.  First, the trainer makes sure that his client is eating the proper food on a regular basis. . . By that, I mean eating so that fat WILL be released from the fat cells. Then and only then they exercise the body to burn the fat. The important idea to take from this is:. . \"The fat can ONLY be burned after it is released from the fat cells\".. . If you know anybody that has been exercising like a maniac and they don't seem to go anywhere, now you know why.. . The reverse is also true, do you know somebody that is eating properly but they are not including any resistance training combined with moderate cardio. Now you know why their body still looks the same.. . All you need to do is to combine a nutrition program, along with some MODERATE cardio program and maintain muscle mass with resistance training. Everything is combined with one goal in mind: Turning your body into an Automatic fat burning machine. It is that easy.. . There is a fina",

The practice is done by an older woman without any specific tool, they just pull and cut.. d) Did you know that in other muslim countries they adopted the practice of sewing the vaginal lips always for the same reason, and that many of those women leave their country and have to undergo painful surgical interventions after that thraumatic experience?. g) did you know muslim immigrants still kill their daughters or sisters when they don't marry the men their parents tell them to marry. (see Germany, Turkey, Paksitan and several other places or simply check AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL). Did you know they burn their women to punish them or that they take them in the squares of their towns and kill them by lapidation with the participation of the whole citizenship?. h) Did you know in Saudi Arabia there is one of the highest rates of paedophilia?. i) Did you know muslims have one of the highest rates of homosexuality?. h) Did you know the highest number of rapists in Europe is made up of Muslims, which is even sadder if you consider their are still a minority in many countries?.

By the way, once you get your braces off, you will feel good about the entire process.  Your smile is worth it.",

They then stick the wire in and close the brackets *at least on mine* As for if they hurt, my orthodontist said you could be sore for a couple days,but I wasn't.

And Adam, that simpleton, ate the apple. This too worked well for millenaries, effectively putting women in subservient position.

        "answer": [
            "Well, if in fact your car was vomitted in, rather than simply smelling like vomit, I would want to know the location of the incident in the vehicle.  If it was primarily in the seats, then what material are your seats?  If they are leather, you are going to need a good scented auto leather cleaner like Touch of Gold.  If the seats are cloth and/or the vomit ended up on the floor, then you will definitely need a heavy duty cleaner and disinfectant.  Lysol will certainly do the trick.  The key is to use as little water as possible, so that you aren't simply spreading it around.  Let it dry completely between cleanings... you should repeat 3 times.  The smell will probably still be there, so it will be a good idea to use carpet fresh just as you would the floors in your home.  Then top it all off with your favorite scent of car air freshener.... I recommend a Car Jar in the Macintosh scent.  you should probably leave your windows cracked during this process so all those smells have a chance to dissipate.. . I wouldn't use some of the harsh chemicals that other people are suggesting, simply because you may end up bleaching/fading/damaging your interior.  Everything I have told you is tried and true.",

        "answer": [
            "What other ppl have said is mostly an ideal 'flowery' way of solvong the problem , be it educating, humanity, love etc. The problem i believe lies in the basic human instinct of making oneself SECURE and Happy . And when their are millions of us on the earth with the same urges,and instincts, ones happiness is surely gonna encroach upon another guys due to competition at every level say, housing, jobs and even hot chiks, which in simple words brings happiness to a human.. So racism is one way ppl try to secure their space and happiness by joining large  groups and safegurding each others interests. Other problems also arise due to the same cause, like terrorism and  and corruption but racism has hit the world for long and bad because there are large numbers of ppl (and their votes) involved,  and larger the group , the stronger they are. Forces of democracy, u could say. .    Not that only democracies have racism. Middle east where the rulers are biased and represent one community also face the brunt of racist/communal riots. But I haven't heard of racist fights in China which is a populous country with minimal democracy. I found the link below about the type of racism in China.. So the trick to cure the disease is, I say, give everyone his share of happiness and handle the miscreants quick and hard.",
            "Just as a fever is a symptom of disease in the body, racism is a symptom of disease in society. Suppressing the symptom does not cure the disease, but curing the disease eliminates the symptom. . . Accordingly, any campaign to eradicate racism must change those attitudes and beliefs. Although necessary, political action alone cannot offer a permanent solution.. . Hearts must be touched by an awareness of the bonds that unite people of all races."

            "Part of the reason is, of course, the emotions involved with some issues.  For example, the images of 9/11 in a new textbook could still cause some people a great amount of grief.. . Another reason is that it is too hard to tell what the impacts of recent events will be.  For example, take the war in Iraq.  While today it is a major issue, in may not be say, if our country were to invade Iran.  While we know what the effects of World War II were, we don't know what the long-term effects of the war in Iraq will be.  So as not to seem as soothsayers, the makers of text books will simply gloss over the recent past.",

If you notice, most history textbooks give a half-assed report of the 1990's through today. That's because too many people will rise up against the book if the authors try to put any personal information in it. For example, when a book says James Buchanan or Martin Van Buren was a bad president, there will be no objections, because they are dead and their parties defunct. If a book says George Bush Sr. was a bad president, there are still people alive to argue against that. Too much stress, so covering recent history broadly is easier for the book publishers."

Thing is that Trinidad is better for commercial concerns and Tobago is the nature lover's location. There are, however, islands with super beaches and water that are 100% geared for tourist (say US) dollars. . . Take a BWIA flight to T & T and you will see the latest tourism documentary."

American aid to Israel was minimal until after the Six Day War, and only took off after Israel saved US ally Jordan from a PLO-Syrian invasion in 1970. The 1979 Camp David Accords, which secured peace between Israel and Egypt, mandated increased aid to Israel to compensate in part for Israel's return of the Sinai and the resulting loss of strategic depth, air bases, training grounds and oil fields.

There was a period during the Middle Ages when the Church banned celebration of Yule (the predecessor of Christmas) because it was Pagan.

Then it was banned again in the Colonial times by the Puritans for the exact same reasons. . . That said, non-religious folks have every right to celebrate Christmas if they so choose and no one has the right to take that away from them.",

That said, if you have Christ as your savior, you eventually walk with Him to the point of not wanting to sin against anyone you love, anyone...especially Christ.  Furthermore, if you do get to heaven and stand in the presence of the Lord, you must account for every idle word, and deed.  Do you want to sit and give excuses to the One who saved you and gave you eternity with Him in a place that will be beyond your greatest dreams?. . You do not have to be bad to go to hell, just lost and deceived.  In my opinion, also scared or lazy.  It is scary at first to give up the life you know in this fallen world and it seems easier to just go on in ignorance of the gift He offers.  Neither option is better than just giving up what this world offers, because in the end you have pain and disappointment either way, and with Jesus, you are never alone.. .

Perhaps the most common of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS), which occurs mainly in teenagers and young adults. It occurs when a person's body clock is running later than it should, resulting in sleep-onset and wakening times that are very late in relation to the daily cycle of life. It is at the extreme end of the 'night owl' syndrome: a night owl will typically choose to stay up until midnight, and sleep until 8 in the morning; a person with DSPS is unable to initiate sleep until well after 1 or 2 am, and has extreme difficulty awakening until late morning or close to noon.. . http://www.sunbox.com/Research/SCRD.asp",

In forward motion, gyroscopic effect also responds to a tilt of the bike by turning the front wheel in the direction of the tilt. This steering repositions the contact patches of the front and rear wheels such that the downforce vector (force due to gravity and centripetal reaction in a turn), projected through the center of mass, intersects the line joining them and thus produces no additional rolling torque on the bike.",

The israelis also used terrorist tactics before they had a state,so lets not start badgering the terrorist thang aroudn here shall we?.  Human rights groups are 'obsessed' with America and its biggest military base, namely Israel, because its you who should be setting a worldwide example..Gitmo, Abu Gahrib, the slaughter of Iraqi civilians by the 'Brave Boys' of the Marine corp...all of it is a shame on your country, and if it takes human rights to tell you, then so be it."

        "question": "What does it mean when your check engine light comes on?",
        "answer": [
            "Check Engine light. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. (Redirected from \"Check Engine\" Light). Jump to: navigation, search. A \"Check Engine\" Light or Service Engine Soon is an indicator of the internal status of a car engine. It is found on the instrument console of most automobiles. When illuminated, it is typically either a red or amber color.. . The \"Check Engine\" Light, also sometimes known as a MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp), can illuminate for any of a very large number of reasons. Typically, the reason is not serious enough to affect drivability of the vehicle. Common causes include: loose gas cap, vehicle due for scheduled maintenance, or problems with the emmision control system (i.e., charcoal canister or oxygen sensor).. . This light became required on passenger cars due to emission control legislation in California, with the intention that the light would illuminate if there was a problem which would cause the vehicle to have excessive pollutant emissions. The owner would be aware that the emission control system needed to be serviced, and would be prevented from renewing their registration in the state of California. [citation needed]. . The \"Check Engine\" Light can also illuminate for reasons which may affect drivability, so it is advisable that one have the vehicle examined by a mechanic at one's earliest convenience. A preliminary diagnostic check can be performed by retrieval of the \"trouble code\" which has caused the light to illuminate. The cost of hooking up a diagnostic computer to retrieve said code varies greatly. Many dealerships charge $99 for this service.[citation needed] Private mechanics typically charge between $50 and $75[citation needed] while AutoZone offers the service for free.. . Once a \"trouble code\" has been pulled, the technician will have a better idea of what the problem may be. These codes are seldom specific, but instead tend to relate to a system of complex parts, thus requiring further diagnosis. Said diagnosis will require paying the hourly labor fee of a skilled technician.[citation needed]",

        "answer": [
            "That's like asking, why don't guys ask questions on Yahoo Answers??? ;). . and FYI I'm a 22/Female been playing video games since I could use an Apple II, then moved on to Sega and Nintendo, then PSX, then PS2, then XBOX, then a pimpin HP gaming PC setup, and soon the PS3. Can't wait for FFXIII!!!!",
            "You have to be sure of what you're asking- why girls don't play video games, or if they do, and you're just not seeing them play them.. . The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) have done surveys and studies on gameplayers and buyers. It goes on to list that the average buyer is 40 years of age, the average gamer is 33 years of age, and 50% of all Americans play video games- that's a rather large chunk out of the population, and it's a longshot to assume that part of that chunk doesn't include girl-gamers.. . Surveys have been conducted to disprove that gamers are predominantly male. While it is true that the average consumer nowadays is 20-30 years old and male, more and more female gamers are being found. A few studies claim that females outnumber males in Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs), and the ESA backs this by claiming that, while not outnumbering females, 48% of the MMO population is female. A substantial number do play games provided by internet services (like word jumbles and puzzles). Perhaps one of the most popular games noted for being played premarily by females is \"The Sims\" series, which is effectively a Life-simulator.. . Even if one disregards this, a number of the most popular video game characters have been female in the past: Lara Croft is one example of sexuality combined with hardcore action and adventure; Samus Aran was a character in Metroid whom every person played thinking she was a male until the very end. It's becoming something of a more attractive theme to have females that play the role of action heros or are otherwise the main characters, rather than males, while simultaneously disregarding the stereotype that all video game females are damsels in distress."

            "The penis, much like the human male, is used for passing urine and for transmission of semen.. It differs from the human penis in that the dog's penis actually has a small bone in it, as well as a bulb near the base on either side, which swells 5 times its size with blood, once the dog has his penis inside the female.. This bulbous, along with the female's vaginal muscle, ensures that the 'tie' cannot be broken until all the semen is pumped from both testicles, which happens as alternative spurts from each teste. . Once the tie has occurred, you MUST WAIT until the female relaxes her vaginal 'locking' muscle and breaks the tie to release the male.. If you attempt to pull them apart, you will cause serious pain and damage to both the male and the female dog."

If that doesn't put an end to this, you should probably consider the person as not a friend who respects you as you are, and disassociate from them. . .

A party of the gods was held and one god named Loki was uninvited he would have been the thirteenth person. this angered him so much that he killed the god of joy. thus the vikings came to say t6hat it is unlucky to have thirteen people in a room.",
