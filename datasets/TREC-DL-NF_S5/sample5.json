            "3_2": "1 Low TSH-Low TSH levels can be a sign that you are dealing with an overactive thyroid gland from conditions such as goiter, noncancerous tumors or Graves's disease. 2  The thyroid may also become overactive during the first trimester of pregnancy. Normal TSH-Adults should have TSH hormone levels that range from 0.4-4.2 mU/L. 2  This indicates that the signals from your pituitary gland match the activity of your thyroid gland.",
            "2_2": "TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, and not by the thyroid as it may seem. The purpose of TSH is to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormone. High TSH levels typically indicates that the body is not receiving enough thyroid hormone. A low TSH level is indicative of the body receiving too much thyroid hormone.",
            "1_21": "These tests may be ordered to help investigate the cause of an enlarged thyroid (goiter) or other signs and symptoms associated with low or high thyroid hormone levels. Testing may be performed as a follow-up when other thyroid test results such as total or free T3, free T4, and/or TSH indicate thyroid dysfunction.",
            "0_80": "The level of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) will also have to be measured, as even if this is not produced by the thyroid glands, it is in charge with controlling the T4 and the T3 hormone production. If the levels of TSH are not normal, the T3 and T4 levels are most likely affected as well."
